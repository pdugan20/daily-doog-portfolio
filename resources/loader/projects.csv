"event-connect","Event Connect","2012 - 2013","Google Research","I worked on Event Connect as a 20% project at Google in the capacity of a designer, prototyper, and front-end engineer. Event Connect is an application designed to coordinate the creation and logistics associated with both internal and external events at Google such as academic conferences and university visits.<br><br>In the course of my time working with the EC team I helped launch major redesigns of large portions of the application’s primary functionality which directly lead to large gains in the overall usability and navigation of Event Connect."
"google-wallet","Google Wallet Reporting Dashboard","Spring 2012","Google","I helped design, build, and deploy an analytics dashboard focused on measuring the productivity and overall quality of the actions taken by a globally distributed operations team at Google. The purpose of this team was to prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring on Google’s payments platform.<br><br>My role on this project was unique in that I built an end-to-end reporting platform which provided unique and customizable views and reports based on the viewer’s job function and employee status.

"healthy-food","Healthy Food in a Box","Fall 2013","University of Washington, HCID 511","Health Food in a Box (HFIB) was a four week project I completed while enrolled in an <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/hcid.html"">analytical design studio (HCID 511)</a> at the University of Washington. The project consisted of brainstorming and iterating upon an idea for technology influenced behavioral change. Over the course of the project I lead a small group through ideation, storyboarding, and cognitive mapping exercises while working toward a proposal for a mock startup pitch.<br><br>Healthy Food in a Box was a proposal for a mobile application and food delivery and distribution platform whose goal was to build regional communities around preparing and eating healthy meals in the home. The application acted as a portal into a personalized produce delivery platform.<br><br>My idea for this project was a variation on traditional CSA produce boxes in that instead of allowing individuals to order boxes full of generic produce, they could instead order and have shipped to their home a complete set of ingredients in the right proportion and cultural preference for their family.<br><br>Deliverables for the project included three separate group presentations which communicated my <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfSDFROTBQN3lqWWc/edit?usp=sharing"">design statement</a>, <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfTUpHQjBNNnRhT2M/edit?usp=sharing"">a user storyboard</a>, and a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfenJENG81VkNGXzA/edit?usp=sharing"">startup-esque pitch</a>."
