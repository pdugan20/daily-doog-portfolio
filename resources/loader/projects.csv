"event-connect","Event Connect","2012 - 2013","Google Research","I spent several months working on Event Connect as a 20% project while employed by Google. Event Connect is an application used internally by Google’s research organization in order to coordinate the creation and logistics associated with the participation of Googlers in events like conferences and tech-talks. While a member of the Event Connect team I worked specifically on an overhaul of Event Connect’s user interface. As a part of that overhaul, I additionally worked to consolidate and simplify the process of creating, volunteering for, and managing events.<br><br>In the course of my time working with the Event Connect team I helped launch major redesigns of large portions of the application’s primary functionality. The designs I helped to implement directly lead to large gains in the overall usability and navigation of Event Connect.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>Upon joining the Event Connect team, I was tasked primarily with refreshing the user interface of the application. Rather than just slapping on a coat of Kennedy paint however, I took a more holistic approach by first understanding the present state of Event Connect and its underlying flaws.<br><br>Since the application had originally grown out of an internal Google hack-a-thon, it unfortunately had never been allocated a dedicated UX Googler. Aside from its dated user-interface, I quickly found that there was room for additional areas of improvement. Mainly, from a user-perspective I found it fairly difficult to:<ul><li>Create a new event</li><li>Manage events that I had created</li><li>Discover interesting upcoming events</li><li>Express interest in volunteering for an event</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Having gained a better understanding of the work ahead of me, I met with the project’s PM and engineering lead to set success milestones for the visual refresh. I advocated for a focus on reducing the time it took for coordinators to create new events while also improving the surfacing of upcoming events to users searching for volunteer opportunities. We agreed as a team that an application redesign wouldn’t be considered successful without a meaningful impact on those key metrics.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having established success criteria, I began work on a set of preliminary sketches for major components of the user-interface. I explored different methods for grouping related events and for dynamic filtering of upcoming and archived events. I additionally met with and garnered feedback from members of the core Event Connect team and individuals not on the immediate team that I identified as power-users through log analysis. I conducted semi-structured interviews with power users of the application to better understand where Event Connect fell short. I also shadowed users as they went through the process of creating new events and updating their previously created events.<br><br>Using observations from my shadowing sessions, I proposed and prototyped in low-fidelity Balsamiq mockups, then later in higher-fidelity Fireworks mockups, a dynamic and consolidated event creation form. I additionally prototyped multiple methods of surfacing top-level events to potential volunteers.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>My final deliverables for the Event Connect team consisted of high-fidelity HTML, CSS, and JQuery based prototypes for the applications home screen, event creation screens, detailed event view screen, volunteering screens, administrative controls, and user profile screens. The redesigned portions of the application reduced the new event creation time by over half, provided context and assistance during the event creation process, increased the visibility of upcoming events, and greatly improved the process of managing Googlers who had expressed interest in volunteer roles for specific events.<br><br>I worked closely with the lead engineer for the team to ensure that the prototypes I handed over were successfully translated into productionised Django templates.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back, there are certainly some lingering issues I would loved to have tackled. The tooltip help-text I handed over in my final deliverable, while generally promoting increased clarity, could have been made clearer in certain instances. I regretted not having the copy cleaner and felt there was still a lot of room for improvement.<br><br>I also regret leaning too heavily on HTML5 placeholder help text throughout the redesign. The problem with placeholder text being that, when users start entering information into a form element the help text immediately disappears. In this instance I unfortunately prioritized aesthetics over usability. Going back I believe there would be room to augment placeholder help text with inline text not dissimilar from the excellent implementation that can be found in the Google Chrome Web Store developer dashboard editing screens.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Event Connect will always hold a special place in my heart as my first long-term 20% project. I really enjoyed working with the project’s PM, <a class=""g-profile"" href=""http://plus.google.com/105367864363518973606"" target=""_blank"">+Melanie Saldana</a>, and lead engineer, <a class=""g-profile"" href=""http://plus.google.com/106139823293781683186"" target=""_blank"">+Eriel Thomas</a>. Both of these individual taught me a great deal and treated me with the utmost respect for the entirety of the time I worked with them. I miss them both a great deal and hope I might be fortunate enough to work with them again some day in the future.","","",""
"google-wallet","Google Wallet Reporting Dashboard","Spring 2012","Google","In the spring of 2012 I helped to design and build an interactive reporting solution for the Google Wallet team. The reporting dashboard I designed presented members of a global operations team with a holistic and dynamic view of account actions taken at an individual and collective level. <br><br>In addition to allowing for the dynamic display and filtering of aggregated operations data, the dashboard also stack-ranked operations team members and assigned individual quality scores based on the number and perceived correctness of the actions they were taking.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>For reasons of security and safety, Google Wallet is supported by a global team of analysts who work to identify and prevent large-scale fraud. These fraud patterns are recognized in part by evaluating individually compromised Google Wallet accounts. While frontline managers of these teams were very concerned with the frequency and accuracy of corrective actions being taken on potentially compromised accounts, they previously had no way to visualize or easily filter through the productivity data associated with their direct reports. <br><br>In order to better understand the actions their reports were taking, managers spent time manually constructing and executing queries against a relational database which they then further segmented into spreadsheets. Additionally, at an operational level analysts had no way of accurately comparing their own actions against those of their peers. The team as a whole required a solution that provided:<ul><li>The ability for managers to view the productivity of analysts as individuals and in comparison against their peers</li><li>The ability for analysts to track their own productivity on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis</li><li>The ability to have data displayed in interactive visualized forms and additionally in an exportable raw data format</li><li>The ability for team members to view a dynamically generated quality score associated with the correctness of the fraud prevention actions they were taking</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Because I had identified the need for and proposed this project, in my discussions with front-line operations managers I was able to clearly articulate criteria for a successful reporting implementation. <br><br>Having gained the input of both managers and operations analysts, we reached a stakeholder consensus that a final solution would need to allow for filtering not just at an individual and aggregated team level, but also across distinct offices and sub-teams within those offices. Although the need to automatically generate quantitative comparison metrics was deemed important, we also recgonized it was equally as critical to provide all team members with the ability to access raw data for their own manipulations.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>I worked over several months with a representative from the Wallet operations team to design, develop, and ultimately implement a desktop based reporting dashboard. Working from an initial set of wireframes which received the approval of managerial stakeholders, I worked to build out both the application scoring logic and database structures before ultimately working on a polished front-end visual implementation.<br><br>As changes were made to the design and functionality of the system, I ensured feedback from all levels of stakeholders were consistently incorporated into ongoing development during weekly team standup meetings.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>The finished implementation of this project was marginally successful in that it accomplished all of the original success criteria our team had agreed upon.<br><br>Because the fundamental goals of this project were to increase the global transparency of team actions while also reducing the time taken to perform operational statistic analysis, I would rate our final solution as a success. Post-construction, fraud analysts were able to better understand their own individual contributions and managers were able to reduce the time required to generate productivity and quality statistics for their direct-reports by almost 75%.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Although I was happy with the way this project turned out and the role I played driving its design and development, looking back I can think of some substantial improvements I would have made.<br><br>I spent too much time early in the project trying to accommodate every use-case through a universal interface before realizing that a better user-experience would be to provide two variations on a common interface for distinct users. Although those two distinct interfaces shared common UI elements, they were ultimately better tailored to address the niche needs of related but different sub-teams within the operations group I was designing for.<br><br>Additionally, I would have loved to have taken more time to improve the granularity of controls for team-leads. I focused specifically on two user groups of the application, those groups being front-line managers and their direct reports. A third group positioned between managers and direct reports, team-leads, would have benefited tremendously from the ability to manipulate specific types of data regarding their peers. I failed to design for this group primarily because I transitioned too quickly into the development stages of the project before conducting enough research around the actual problems I was trying to solve.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>I learned a tremendous amount on this project from both design and development perspectives. I ultimately gained a lot of valuable experience learning to balance the needs of very different stakeholder groups. Even though I believe there was room for improvement on the final deliverables that came out of my work on this reporting solution, I was pleased with the value it delivered to the Google Wallet team.","","",""
"lm-prototypes","Liberty Mutual Interaction Design (Various Projects)","2010 - 2011","Liberty Mutual Insurance","While working at Liberty Mutual I collaborated closely with several product teams in a prototyping and interaction design capacity. Specifically, I aided the iOS, Android, mobile/desktop consumer web, and eService account management teams with the creation of prototypes based on interactions I helped to design. While working with these teams I helped design multiple iterations of Liberty’s <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/liberty-mutual-mobile"">native mobile applications</a>, <a href=""http://mobile.libertymutual.com/"">mobile</a> and <a href=""http://libertymutual.com/"">desktop</a> websites, <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office"">insurance office locator web-app</a>, and <a href=""https://eservice.libertymutual.com/PmEServiceDesktopClient/es/accmgt/login.html#login"">eService account management web-app</a>.<br><br>Because Liberty Mutual employed a single user-experience team which effectively loaned designers out to distinct product teams for short and long-term project work, I worked on a variety of consumer facing projects during my time with the company.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>From an organizational perspective, a problem with Liberty Mutual’s product teams was that they lacked dedicated designers. Instead of having embedded design and user-experience staff associated with each of Liberty’s product areas, instead a single design and user-experience team loaned its members to product teams on a temporary basis.<br><br>Because there was no unified method of design across teams, each project I contributed interaction design work toward required a very different set of deliverables to be handed off to their engineering teams. Due to this lack of unified structure, I was required to contribute very different types of interactions and artifacts on a project-to-project basis.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>I began each project at Liberty Mutual be meeting with PMs, developers, and business analysts separately to better understand the problem space I was entering and to also better understand the expectations each team held of my role as a designer. I found a lot of success at Liberty Mutual by very clearly articulating to a project’s stakeholders as early as possible the types of work I would be performing, the methodologies by which I would be performing that work, and the artifacts through which that work would manifest itself. For example, some product teams preferred actual frontend HTML and CSS while others preferred high-fidelity clickable prototypes with inline requirement annotations.<br><br>Setting expectations early and communicating those expectations in both written and visual forms saved me from doing a lot of unnecessary work that stakeholders either didn’t require or didn’t care for. It was a great lesson to learn early in my career as a designer.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having set expectations in terms of deliverables and a timeline for delivery, I also worked and interacted with project teams on a basis that suited their specific needs. Usually I began projects by better understanding the problems that a specific project was attempting to solve. Because I usually entered projects at a stage when their goals had already been defined, I typically didn’t have as much input into defining project constraints as I would have liked.<br><br>My typical design methods for a project started with more abstract methods like mind-mapping a problem space or conducting semi-structured user-interviews with Liberty’s current customers to better understand the shortcomings of our digital offerings. Having better understood the constraints around a project, I then moved into lower fidelity pen and paper prototypes which, after soliciting stakeholder feedback, would work their way through multiple iterations into wireframes.<br><br>Having created and received wireframe approval, I would then move into a stage of high-fidelity design. In this stage I created pixel-perfect static screens which could then be incorporated into both dynamic interactive prototypes and additionally into requirements documents with visible grids and measurements. These refined artifacts would then be used to inform and guide development teams in an iterative quality assurance process where I called out and corrected discrepancies between the productionised implementations and my original designs.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really happy with the finished results of the majority of the projects I did design and interactive prototyping work for while employed at Liberty Mutual. The screenshots I’ve included in this portfolio writeup include samples from prototypes I built for Liberty Mutual’s android claims application and desktop web mobile overview pages using Axure RP. There were times when I was frustrated by the way certain constraints impacted my design work. A good example of that frustration is visible in the finished design for Liberty’s <a href=”http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office”>insurance office locator</a> in that I was required to use Bing Maps even after advocating for a Google Maps API integration. <br><br>Working with constraints, for better or worse, is simply a part of any design process. It’s something that I’ve sought to improve working around on a personal and professional level.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on the design work I did at Liberty Mutual, there are a number of improvements I would have liked to have made across multiple projects. The original mobile page I designed suffered from overly small touch areas in its top-level menu structure which made navigation difficult depending on the size and resolution of the mobile phone being used to browse the site.<br><br>In another example of potential improvement, the office locator I designed didn’t default to an individuals current location automatically. Instead, the location tool always required some sort of manual input on the users behalf. I advocated for this feature heavily and incorporated different treatments of that functionality into my design proposals but it was ultimately trimmed from the projects production release due to limited engineering resources.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Working at Liberty Mutual was my first professional exposure to user-experience. I gained a tremendous amount of experience working on some of Liberty’s consumer facing products and I learned a great deal from the talented designers and user-experience professionals I was fortunate enough to work alongside. Although I have no regrets about departing Liberty Mutual for a role with Google, I will always fondly remember my time at Liberty and I’m proud to see elements of my design work displayed across their products years later.","","01,Home screen prototype-02,Claim selection prototype-03,Auto details prototype-04,Auto images prototype-05,Desktop mobile web information prototype-06,Desktop iOS information prototype","&#xf0c1;,LM.com mobile optimized website,http://goo.gl/YDVi7d-&#xf0c1;,LM.com mobile application portfolio overview,http://goo.gl/7sJyLV"
"transparency-report","Distorted Imagery Transparency Report","Summer 2013","Google","I worked for several months in the summer of 2013 to design the user interface and interactions for an as yet unreleased section of the Google Transparency Report. The report I worked on focused specifically on the display of blurred and distorted aerial imagery in Google Maps. I worked directly with the Transparency Report’s PM and stakeholders from the Google Maps team to create an interface that allowed individuals to categorize and filter distorted aerial imagery by both distortion type and geographic location.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The single biggest problem I faced on this project was the nature of the data I was attempting to display. Existing sections of the Transparency Report historically featured dense amounts of data which were then augmented with interactive graphs using the Google Visualization API. Each report was text-heavy by design.<br><br>When designing a report for distorted aerial imagery, I was faced with the problem of departing from the Transparency Reports historical conventions. I was tasked with creating a report that prioritized and prominently displayed images while also providing the rich data and context that users had come to expect from Google’s transparency reporting. As these two objectives could at times be at odds with one another, the problems I faced as a designer were somewhat substantial.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before beginning substantial work on this project, I met with the Transparency Report’s PM, a previous designer who had worked with the team, a Google Map’s quality-lead, and a Google Earth imagery engineer to better understand the problem space and some of the larger obstacles standing in the way of a successful implementation.<br><br>Having met with these individuals and gained their input, our team decided that in order for a new report to be considered successful it would need to prominently display imagery in a manner that allowed for dynamic filtering and categorization. We also agreed upon the need for users to have the ability to view and export additional data associated with the images that fell within their filtering preferences.<br><br>The final deliverables for the project were designated as a set of high-fidelity static mockups that we could present to an engineering team. That engineering team, pending their approval, would then allocate the appropriate resources to begin working on an productionised implementation.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>I worked through the project in several stages of fidelity. I began first with pen and paper interface sketches before migrating some of my early work to low-fidelity Balsamiq screens. Using those Balsamiq screens through several iterations, I gained feedback from project stakeholders before moving to higher-fidelity Fireworks screens.<br><br>After migrating my early interface designs to higher-fidelity mockups, I then prototyped the interactions of a user through multiple scenarios within the distorted imagery report. I specifically focused on visually representing and understanding the interactions involved with multi-country distortion filtering.<br><br>Additionally, I worked closely with the project team to ensure that user’s viewing the report for the first time weren’t immediately overwhelmed with imagery out of context. I created several visual treatments for grouping together related images in order to promote clarity and understanding for new and returning users.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really happy with the way my contributions on the project turned out. My final deliverables for this project were a set of high-fidelity mockups with well-defined interactions for key user scenarios. I unfortunately returned to graduate school before seeing the project get the chance to move further along past the initial design work I contributed.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back, there are certainly some areas of improvement I wish I’d had additional time to tackle. Specifically, I would have liked to have presented clearer indications to viewers of the report about the type of aerial distortions which were present. There are a number of different distortions within Google Maps (camouflage, pixelation, masks, etc) and I unfortunately didn’t incorporate a method for users to gain additional understanding into the elements that made up each distortion type.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>I had an awesome time working with the Transparency Report team and learned a great deal about Google’s transparency efforts in the process. Since this was one of the last major projects I worked on before departing Google for graduate school, it is a little bittersweet thinking back on this project in particular. Overall though, I’m glad I was able to assist the transparency team and consider myself fortunate they were able to bring me on in a design capacity.","","",""
"usmc-pro-fitness","USMC ProFitness","Spring 2012","United States Marine Corps","I set a new year’s resolution at the beginning of 2012 to design and build an end-to-end Android application. The result of that resolution was USMC ProFitness. The application I designed calculates a <a href=""http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/how-to-prepare/pft"">Physical Fitness Test (PFT)</a> score based on guidelines published by the United States Marine Corps.<br><br>Using the inputs of a user’s gender and age coupled with their 3-mile run time, 2 minute sit-up count, and maximum pull-up count, USMC ProFitness allows users to calculate and track their fitness scores over time and to share those scores with others.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>I chose to build USMC ProFitness primarily because the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrios.marinepft"">best-in-class Android PFT solution</a> circa early 2012 was quite over designed. Calculating a score, viewing archived scores, and sharing scores on existing solutions was extremely difficult. I realized there was a lot of room to simplify the process.<br><br>Additionally since this was my first time building an Android application in its entirety, I appreciated the well structured logic that went into calculating a physical fitness score. From a programmatic standpoint I identified this as a great starter Android project.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before beginning the design process, I decided that whatever solution I ended up implementing would need to reduce the time and overall number of steps required to calculate a PFT score on existing solutions. Additionally, I wanted to limit the number of ancillary features which had permeated the existing solution space. Therefor, I also decided that my project would need calculate only a PFT score, and additionally create an easy mechanism for viewing and sharing previously recorded scores.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having taken numerous PFTs myself, I was already intimately familiar with the problem space. I did however conduct interviews with Marines who were both Android and iOS users so that I could better understand how they were using current solutions and what problems they felt needed to be addressed.Thinking back on the initial criteria I had defined for success, I began by sketching out different flows and interactions through which a user would create a profile, input score variables, and ultimately view their score reports. I then used those early sketches to create a low-fidelity clickable prototype that I demoed with the same group of Marines I had interviewed at the projects onset. <br><br>Having gained initial feedback on my early designs, I spent several weeks programming the the applications scoring logic and database structures. After some initial testing and bug fixes, I then implemented the high-fidelity designs I had originally created in a series of Android linear layouts.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I released USMC ProFitness into the Android marketplace in early 2012 and within six months it had garnered over 5,000 unique downloads. Feedback was initially positive until a bug introduced in newer versions of Android caused users to receive inaccurate score reports. Overall I was happy that I had created a simplified score calculation solution and additionally pleased that I had gained a more holistic understanding of the Android application development process.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>I would love to at some future date to address several bugs that have cropped up in USMC ProFitness. A well designed solution doesn’t amount to much if the programmatic logic behind that solution is flawed.<br><br>I would also love to refresh the application to more closely adhere to Android’s design principles and patterns. Looking at the application today, its glaringly obvious that I could get rid of chrome in a lot of places,<a href=""http://developer.Android.com/design/building-blocks/buttons.html"">like the buttons</a>, and would make the app more pleasing to use as a result.<br><br>Additionally, I think there’s a lot that could be done with more extensible storage. The database I used in my first release of USMC ProFitness was a locally embedded SQLite relational database. Embedding the database locally meant that, if a user were to uninstall the application from their phone or tablet, they would lose their data. A great future project would be to sync that local database with an online storage solution like Google Cloud SQL.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>This project was a great learning experience on a personal level. Although I had contributed to Android projects prior to designing and building USMC ProFitness, completing an end-to-end solution myself has since helped to inform my design choices on future mobile projects now that I have a richer understanding of the Android development process. I hope to one day soon find time to refresh the design and to squash some of those scoring bugs!<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.patdugan.usmcprofitness""><img src=""https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png""/></a>","","01,Home screen-02,Profile creation-03,Test selection-04,Test score reporting-05,Previous test scores","&#xf016,Low fidelity application wireframes,http://goo.gl/KkCxkZ-&#xf0c1;,USMC ProFitness github page,http://goo.gl/x2A4Ca"
"google-glass","Husky Football Google Glass Collaboration","Ongoing","University of Washington","I am currently working on a Google Glass research project with Eve Riskin and Jessica Tran in the department of Electrical Engineering at UW. Our project aims to quantify improvements in the on-field performance of University of Washington NCAA football players by leveraging live and recorded video captured with Glass as a training mechanism . <br><br>Additionally, my team is using Glass as a medium by which to promote a STEM curriculum to middle school students. We are accomplishing this by running interactive programs at outreach events like UW’s <a href=""https://www.cs.washington.edu/openhouse"">computing open house</a>.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The primary goal of this project is to provide the University of Washington football team with richer training and analysis materials in order to allow players to more effectively acclimate themselves with their playbook curriculum.<br><br>The Huskies current training methodology provide players with iPads which come installed with two separate applications. One application shows static drawings of football plays, the other shows a list of videos filmed from the sidelines of each play. Neither application communicates with the other. The problem therein lies that current football players have trouble:<ul><li>understanding what a football play looks like in motion</li><li>understanding what their individual role looks like in the context of a larger play</li><li>understanding the perspectives of their teammates while a play is being executed</li></ul>Additionally, the football coaching staff also have trouble effectively understanding the actions or decision making process of their players due to their limited sideline perspective and viewing angles.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>At the onset of this project, our team decided that we needed to build a solution that meaningfully translated interactive learning materials into more effective on-field performance. As this project is still ongoing, we are currently working with the Husky coaching staff to develop metrics by which those quantifications can be measured.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>My team and I are still developing and testing solutions we believe will be useful to football coaches and their players. Having gone through several early meetings with stakeholders from the Husky football team, we quickly realized that a prime area for further enhancement was the development of interactive teaching aids using video and data captured from Google Glass.<br><br>We also agreed upon the fact that, while we believed Glass might provide useful in other ways, that at least initially we would focus on using Glass to capture video in soft-touch helmetless practice sessions rather than in full-contact scenarios.<br><br>My team and I are currently building out a learning platform that allows for players to view a football play’s wireframe schematic, put that schematic into motion, and then toggle the viewing perspective of the play between different offensive and defensive positions. We believe that by providing players additional context into how their teammates perform and interact with one another, that we can provide a more cohesive understanding of how plays are executed and how player’s complementary strengths are leveraged.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>Since my team and I are still designing, developing, and testing different solutions, I’ll be able to share more about our outcomes later this year.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>An early area we’ve been able to identify for future improvement is improved communication between our research team and stakeholders from our Husky football partners. Since we have been working with the football team during their regular season, their limited time resources have slowed the development of our project. We are exploring ways to make better use of the time we do have with the football team and are also attempting to improve the facilitation of ideas between both parties.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>The cross-functional collaboration of our research team has provided me with a truly excellent learning environment. I’m currently working with students of all ages and backgrounds across my own HCI department, UW’s Computer Science department, and the school of Electrical Engineering.

"academy-of-art","Collected Academy of Art Projects","2012 - 2013","Academy of Art University","While working full-time at Google, I pursued a part-time study in the school of Web Design & New Media at the San Francisco Academy of Art University. As a part-time student and taking night-classes, I completed the following four courses:<ul><li>Design Technology (WNM105)</li><li>Visual Design Principles (WNM110)</li><li>User Experience I (WNM120)</li><li>Sketching for Communication (FND113)</li></ul>The courses in which I was enrolled were designed to build a student’s competency with the Adobe Creative suite while also reinforcing the foundations of visual design and user experience.  <div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>Although I had gained a significant amount of professional user experience exposure at the time of my enrollment in the Academy of Art University, I realized that in order to become a better Interaction Designer I needed to build upon my visual design competency. I would call my design work up until this point adequate, but I knew that exposure to individuals with deep artistic backgrounds would benefit my own skill-set tremendously. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Upon enrolling at the Academy of Art, I defined criteria by which I would define the success of my coursework. Specifically, I wanted to enhance my understanding of the Adobe Creative Suite in so far that it would aid and enhance my ability to design interactions. <br><br>I don’t think of myself as a visual designer. I believe I am most effective when working as an interaction and experience designer that uses visual design as a supplement to convey and inform others of the interactions I create.<br><br>Additionally, I wanted to expand my understanding of the design work that went into creating websites and applications. At the time of my initial enrollment, I had a great deal of web development experience but far less experience thinking and reflecting upon the user-centered design work that preceded actual development.<br><br>Furthermore, I also decided that I would not accept on a personal level any final grade below an A-.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>I pursued coursework primarily in the department of Web Design & New Media with an additional elective in the Foundations program that focused on visual communication through sketching. I began classes in the summer of 2012 and concluded my time at the academy in the spring of 2013 shortly before I departed the bay area for Seattle. <div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really happy that I had the chance to build out my understanding and competency in the area of visual design. Regardless of a designer’s field or area of expertise, having a diverse and complementary background across multiple design disciplines helps inform ones work by providing a richer background of experiences from which they can draw.<br><br>I was able to meet some really talented instructors and students while enrolled at the school.

"lm-rss","Liberty Mutual RSS Consolidation","Winter 2011","Liberty Mutual Insurance","While working as a member of Liberty Mutual’s user experience team I proposed and led a project that examined the current state of the various RSS feeds across Liberty’s consumer facing web properties. Then, having conducted a competitive analysis of the methods by which RSS was incorporated into competing insurance websites, I created a set of proposals for a series of small RSS-centric projects. <br><br>The aim of these projects was to present a more unified RSS experience across Liberty’s websites while also consolidating similar feeds, eliminating duplicated feeds, and focusing content within feeds to be be more narrowly focused on our company’s target demographic. <div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The reason I proposed and began the initial work on this project was due to the state of Liberty Mutual’s various RSS feeds being quite disparate in early 2011. RSS feeds were incorporated on six of Liberty’s web properties. In each case, the methods by which the RSS feed was represented was different. <br><br>Similarly, different explanations were provided within each site of what an RSS feed was and how an individual might use that feed. Finally, the content within Liberty’s many feeds was in most cases not specific to the insurance industry and consisted of a variety of miscellaneous and sometimes irrelevant articles. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before moving forward with the project, I worked with my user-experience peers and managers to identify criteria for success. Specifically, we decided that any RSS project should at a minimum:<ul><li>Put into place mechanisms to measure subscribers to RSS feeds</li><li>Consolidate sitewide definitions of RSS</li><li>Create a singular page from which users could subscribe to multiple RSS feeds in a consistent fashion</li><li>Eliminate ancillary RSS feeds while also ensuring the content within feeds was specific to the insurance industry</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Before moving too far into my own consolidation project, I extensively researched RSS best practices incorporated by Liberty Mutual’s insurance competitors. I additionally researched consumer usage of RSS feeds and the methods by which individuals interacted with various RSS services in existence at the time.<br><br>In an informal feedback poll I sent out to current Liberty Mutual subscribers, I was able to ascertain that a small subset of our users did in fact use RSS readers on a regular basis. Of that subset, a surprising majority expected companies like Liberty Mutual to produce insurance themed RSS feeds. That minority also expressed interest in subscribing to insurance feeds they found relevant to their own lives.<br><br>Having conducted broader RSS market research and also having completed an extensive in-house analysis of Liberty’s own RSS treatments, I created a set of proposals that I presented to an engineering managerial audience. The goal of my presentations was to advocate for engineering resources to implement my proposed RSS unification and consolidation projects.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really pleased with the findings of the research I conducted and with the proposals I put forward for future project work. Unfortunately, although I received positive feedback and support following my presentation, due to limited engineering constraints my proposals were approved for future work but weren’t actually allocated engineering resources. This effectively placed them in a state of limbo where the remained until I departed Liberty Mutual for Google.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on this project, I spent a lot of time focusing my research on the RSS solutions that had been implemented by insurance companies. I would have done well to have broadened my research earlier in the project to the implementation of RSS feeds regardless of site content.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Although I was disappointed that I was unable carry any of my proposals through to fruition, I was happy that I was able to interface with a variety of different stakeholders. I was similarly pleased that rather than having a well defined problem handed to me, I instead identified and presented concise solutions for a problem space that others had failed to recognize as being important. I learned quite a bit from this project.","","","&#xf016,LM.com RSS overview,http://goo.gl/0f0zJG-&#xf016,LM.com RSS recommendation document,http://goo.gl/wjJmkF"
"mhiguera","Website Design for Law Offices of Marie Higuera","Fall 2011","Law Offices of Marie Higuera","In the Fall of 2011 I was contracted by Marie Higuera to create a  <a href=""http://mhiguera.com/"">website for her law office</a>. I worked closely with Marie on this project to better understand her desire for creating a website and to help her generate effective content and marketing materials for her law firm.<br><br>In addition to designing a web presence for Marie, I also helped her partner with the hosting service <a href=""http://www.hostgator.com/"">HostGator</a> and trained her administrative assistant in the use of high-level CSS and HTML so that he could maintain the site after its launch.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem I was solving for on this project was that the law offices of Marie Higuera lacked any sort of meaningful online presence. This was especially problematic as many competing smaller law offices in Seattle has substantial online presence and were driving significant client acquisitions through their online reach.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>I met with Marie several times at the projects start to establish a set of criteria by which we would define the project’s success. Specifically we agreed that the final implementation would need to be able to:<ul><li>Provide Marie’s staff with metrics for tracking visitors</li><li>Provide meaningful calls-to-action that allowed visitors to directly contact Marie’s office by phone</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>While designing this site for Marie, I met with her on a recurring weekly basis to update her as to progress I was making and elicit her feedback throughout all stages of design. I used low-fidelity wireframes early in the project’s design stage and, having ensured that we were placing appropriate emphasis on her firm’s content, moved forward with the construction of higher-fidelity mocks.<br><br>Having received Marie’s final approval on my high-fidelity designs, I moved forward with development and the eventual implementation of her design. Post-launch, I worked closely with Marie’s administrative assistant and created a series of training documents that explained the methods by which he could update and add new site content.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was happy with the way the website turned out. The project accomplished the initial success criteria that I had laid out with Marie and it began driving a non-trivial amount of traffic to her firm within two months of having been launched. Although I’ve seen the site slowly degrade in performance and the consistency of its design as updates have been made to it over the past two years, I still believe that it is accomplishing its purpose quite well despite now needing what probably amounts to a minor refresh.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back, I can clearly identify changes I would have made to the final deliverable. Whereas Marie insisted that she needed a rotating slideshow of historic Seattle landmarks on the front-page, I should have pushed back and advocated for a cleaner less distracting site that prioritized her firm instead of the city of Seattle. I can also see she added transparent images to her site’s slideshow that overlap one another and which don’t speak to the professionalism of her firm’s work.<br><br>Additionally, although calls-to-action were incorporated throughout the site, the ability to place calls to her firm could have been prioritized higher in the hierarchy of certain pages.<br><br>Finally, due to the constraints of the original project, I implemented the site in a single language (English), when really I should have also incorporated a Spanish language version. Since so many of her clients were from Mexico and spoke English as a second-language, I should have incorporated dual language versions of the website into my initial success criteria.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>This project represented some of the first freelance work I did after departing from Liberty Mutual. While I was certainly constrained in the amount of time I had available to spend on the project, I was ultimately happy with the finish result.

"lm-nav","LibertyMutual.com Navigational User-Studies","Fall 2010","Liberty Mutual Insurance","In the Fall of 2010 I helped lead an effort to consolidate the site-map and hierarchy of information across Liberty Mutual’s various public websites. The study broke apart 50 site links and categories into individual cards and asked participants to group and categorize the cards as individuals before breaking into groups and repeating the exercise together.<br><br>The study took place over the course of several weeks after which my UX team spent several additional weeks quantifying our data with the methodology outlined in Donna Spencer's book <a href=""http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/card-sorting/"">Card Sorting Designing Usable Categories</a>. The eventual outcome of the project consolidated Liberty Mutual's site-map from 18 base categories into 6 and provided a foundation from which we were able to design a consolidated mega-menu.","","",""
"mobile-claims","Liberty Mutual Mobile Claims App","2010 - 2011","Liberty Mutual Insurance","While employed as a member of Liberty Mutual’s user-experience team I helped to design and build Liberty’s first <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liberty-mutual-mobile/id397404511?mt=8"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lmig.pm.internet.mobile.android.libertymutual&hl=en"">Android</a> applications.<br><br>Both applications allowed current Liberty Mutual customers to manage their insurance accounts and to file automobile insurance claims. I joined Liberty’s mobile development team in late 2010 and worked first to help launch the company’s iOS app before adjusting my focus to concentrate on launching an Android variant.<br><br>Both applications were well received in the marketplace and Liberty’s iOS application was featured as an example in a Forrester Research best-in-class mobile user-experience white paper. <div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem this project aimed to solve was that Liberty Mutual was one of the last insurance companies to offer native mobile applications to their customers for account and insurance claim management purposes. Liberty Mutual’s customer demographic, while older in age, was frustrated by the fact they they couldn’t manage their insurance policies from their mobile phones. Additionally, in cases where our customers had been in a physical accident, they required the means to digitally record information about damage caused to their cars.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before beginning major development for this project, myself and another member of our user-experience team designed an initial interactive iOS prototype based on criteria we had identified and ranked as being the most important to current Liberty Mutual customers. We used that prototype in a series of user research studies to better understand the expectations of our customers and to establish baseline functionality which we would target in the first release of our application.  <br><br>We were able to establish that a solution would need to offer users the ability to:<ul><li>Record rich data associated with automobile accidents</li><li>Easily talk to an insurance representative regardless of a user’s location within the application</li><li>View and update their current insurance information</li><li>View the status of an insurance claim after it had been filed</li></ul>We also deemed it was important to set into place tracking mechanisms so that we could establish an understanding of how many of our customers were using the application and for what purposes.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having established success criteria, I worked with an an information architect and a small team of mobile developers to begin significant construction of our application. Our team worked through several short iterative sprints developing core functionality that we then integrated together in a cohesive fashion.<br><br>During multiple stages of development, I contributed wireframes, requirements documents with inline annotations, and interactive clickable prototypes to our developer and business stakeholders. As developers implemented features, I also ran quality assurance tests looking for bugs and ensuring the our finished implementations aligned to my original design work.<br><br>Prior to publicly launching our application, I helped to plan and conduct an additional round of users studies. The feedback from those studies was ultimately incorporated in a final set of usability improvements.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>Our initial iOS application launch went extremely well considering it was our first in-house mobile development release. Members of the original iOS team and myself released the Android variant of our claims app several months later to similarly positive reviews.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Due to time constraints, the Android application our team released was in many ways a ported version of the application we released on iOS. Looking back, there was a substantial amount of android specific functionality our team neglected to implement.<br><br>Additionally, my team relied on webviews for specific account management functions rather than natively building features into our Android application. I would have loved to have taken additional time to build out a true native experience rather than use modified webviews as a developmental crutch.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Looking at both applications today, I can still see evidence of my original design work. However, the applications themselves look and feel very different. Unfortunately, neither app today closely adheres to either iOS or Android design guidelines. <br><br>I was extremely proud to have positively impacted this project so heavily as a recent college graduate. Being as this was my first exposures to design in a professional setting, I gained a tremendous amount of experience in a very short time.<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lmig.pm.internet.mobile.android.libertymutual""><img alt=""Android app on Google Play"" src=""https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png"" /></a><br><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liberty-mutual-mobile/id397404511?mt=8""><img src=""http://public.libertymutual-cdn.com/MediaBin/PersonalMarket/SharedImages/app_store.gif?version=33122106156""/></a>","","01,Home screen-02,Auto claim (1)-03,Auto claim (2)-04,Filed claims-05,Add pictures","&#xf0c1;,Application storyboards and information hierarchy,http://goo.gl/qBV9pv-&#xf0c1;,Forrester Research usability citation,http://goo.gl/yLySpU"

"healthy-food","Healthy Food in a Box","Fall 2013","University of Washington, HCID 511","Health Food in a Box (HFIB) was a four week project I completed while enrolled in an <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/hcid.html"">analytical design studio (HCID 511)</a> at the University of Washington. The project consisted of selecting a problem space and iterating through potential solutions that advocated for technology influenced behavioral change. Over the course of the project I helped lead a small group through ideation, storyboarding, and cognitive mapping exercises. The final deliverable for this project was a pitch presentation my team delivered to the executive committee of the University of Washington HCI program.<br><br>A key tenant of this project aimed to build regional communities around preparing and eating healthy meals in the home. The mobile application we proposed designing acted as a portal into a personalized produce delivery platform.<br><br>My team’s final proposal was a variation on traditional CSA produce boxes in that instead of allowing individuals to order boxes full of generic produce, they could instead order and have shipped to their home a complete set of ingredients in the right proportion and cultural preference for their family.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem space my group and I identified centered around healthy eating in a family setting. Specifically, we identified the need for working parents to more effectively be able to plan, shop for, and prepare healthy, minimally-processed meals for their families.<br><br>Our final solution proposal proposed a cross-platform mobile app that paired with an on-demand regional food delivery service. We envisioned parents creating a family profile which specified the number of individuals in their household and their specific diet preferences. Users of the app would then be able to shop for recipes and would be able to have the all the ingredients used in preparing those recipes shipped to their home within a timeframe of their own choosing. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>While we initially sought to target families across all income ranges and geographic areas within the United States, we quickly narrowed our focus and instead designed a solution we believed worked well for medium and upper-income families with one or two working parents. <br><br>In order for our project to be successful, we agreed that our solution would need to:<ul><li>Significantly differentiate itself from traditional CSA boxes</li><li>Advocate for ordering meals in as few steps as possible similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468482"">Amazon 1-click ordering</a></li><li>Be tested in urban areas where economies of scales could be leveraged to reduce delivery costs</li><li>Quickly build algorithms that could reliably forecast future produce purchases to increase ingredient freshness while also reducing warehousing costs</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having laid out an initial body of work and success metrics upon which we could benchmark our potential solutions, my team and I moved forward by conducting extensive market research into academic studies concerned with healthful eating. We also examined current best practices and the associated research involved with designing for behavioral change. We quickly identified and moved forward with BJ Fogg’s <a href=""http://www.behaviormodel.org/"">behavioral change model</a> and used it to inform our early designs.<br><br>Having gained a better understanding our our problem space, we drafted a series of personas and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfTUpHQjBNNnRhT2M/edit?usp=sharing"">user storyboards</a> that laid out in detail our produce delivery process. Using those storyboards, we were able to develop a refined understanding of what features were the most important to leverage in our proposed solution.<br><br>Using the understanding we gained through our storyboarding exercises, my team and I drafted an initial set of wireframes and used them as a basis for creating a refined <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfenJENG81VkNGXzA/edit?usp=sharing"">pitch</a> that we ultimately presented to a faculty review board. <div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>My team’s final presentation was well received by our audience. Additionally, the knowledge I gained on this project proved invaluable. I improved my ability to identify a problem space, narrow the focus of my work, understand of constraints within that space, and to design a solution that at its core influenced the behavior of users in the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices.<br><br>The goal of this project was not to deliver a finished product, but rather, to deliver a pitch which convincingly advocated for pursuing a problem and proposed solution further. To that end, I believe my team and I did an excellent job framing and articulating our arguments.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on this project our team stumbled at certain points. Specifically, we failed to clearly articulate and gain consensus on our criteria for success early in the project. This lack of early consensus resulted in individuals pursuing very different paths of research and ideation we led to an ineffective use of our already constrained resources.<br><br>Additionally, our team black-boxed the more complicated portions of our proposal that involved the regional on-demand logistics of produce delivery. I believe that if we had conducted additional research into potential delivery partnerships, that we could have presented a more convincing argument to our faculty audience.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Healthy Food in a Box was the first longer-term project I worked on in my HCI masters program. The experience of getting to know my peers was invaluable, and I learned a tremendous amount about designing for behavioral change. I was pleased with the final solutions my team and I proposed and would love to at some future date build out some of our application wireframes into a higher fidelity.","","01,Recipe discovery-02,Recipe push notification-03,Detailed recipe screen-04,Order confirmation-05,Alternate recipe screen-06,Farm details screen","&#xf016;,Design statement presentation,http://goo.gl/4898Db-&#xf016,User storyboard flows,http://goo.gl/ykrl3D-&#xf016,Pitch presentation,http://goo.gl/SZs0et"

We eventually moved forward with a model of hybrid automation in which our car abstracted away control from the driver in situations where it could make a definitive decision regarding the manipulation of non mission-critical systems.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem my team and I were solving for was the generally poor state of in-car information and entertainment interfaces. With several notable exceptions, one being Tesla, the vast majority of present-day vehicle user interfaces offer a poor user-experience.After performing a body of secondary competitive research, our team listed some of the primary issues with current in-car interfaces as being:<ul><li>Poor integration of a driver's smartphone with a car’s native computing systems</li><li>Overly complex nested menu structures for tasks like wayfinding</li><li>Inappropriately small touch-areas for primary interactions</li><li>Lack of supplementary analog controls to augment touch-screens</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>As my team and I moved forward with our project, we quickly realized that we needed to make the primary functionality of our car’s user interface extremely easy to use. We agreed that our final interface should be non-distracting to a driver, promote quick inputs and interactions, and be mapped in a way where a driver could perform functions without removing their eyes from the road. Additionally, we created a baseline metric that no primary interface interaction should require more than two seconds of a driver's attention from the time of intent to completion of action.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>In the context of my four person team, I worked as the primary interaction designer on this project.
