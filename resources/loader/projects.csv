"event-connect","Event Connect","2012 - 2013","Google Research","I spent several months working on Event Connect as a 20% project while employed by Google. Event Connect is an application used internally by Google’s research organization in order to coordinate the creation and logistics associated with the participation of Googlers in events like conferences and tech-talks. <br><br>While a member of the Event Connect team I worked specifically on an overhaul of Event Connect’s user interface. As a part of that overhaul, I additionally worked to consolidate and simplify the process of creating, volunteering for, and managing events.<br><br>In the course of my time working with the Event Connect team I helped launch major redesigns of large portions of the application’s primary functionality. The designs I helped to implement directly lead to large gains in the overall usability and navigation of Event Connect.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>Upon joining the Event Connect team I was tasked primarily with refreshing the user interface of the application. Since the application had originally grown out of an internal Google hack-a-thon, it unfortunately had never been allocated a dedicated UX Googler. Aside from its dated user-interface, I quickly found that there was room for additional areas of improvement. Specifically, most users found it fairly difficult to:<ul><li>Create a new event</li><li>Manage events that I had created</li><li>Discover interesting upcoming events</li><li>Express interest in volunteering for an event</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear bullet-margin-fix"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Having gained a better understanding of the work ahead of me, I met with the project’s PM and engineering lead to set success milestones for the visual refresh. I advocated for a focus on reducing the time it took for coordinators to create new events while also improving the surfacing of upcoming events to users searching for volunteer opportunities. We agreed as a team that an application redesign wouldn’t be considered successful without a meaningful impact on those key metrics.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>Having established success criteria, I began work on a set of preliminary sketches for major components of the user-interface. I explored different methods for grouping related events and for dynamic filtering of upcoming and archived events. I additionally met with and garnered feedback from members of the core Event Connect team and individuals not on the immediate team that I identified as power-users through log analysis. I conducted semi-structured interviews with power users of the application to better understand where the felt the application was falling short. I also shadowed users as they went through the process of creating new events and updating their previously created events.<br><br>Using observations from my shadowing sessions, I proposed and prototyped in low-fidelity Balsamiq mockups, then later in higher-fidelity Fireworks mockups, a dynamic and consolidated event creation form. I additionally prototyped multiple methods of surfacing top-level events to potential volunteers.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>My final deliverables for the Event Connect team consisted of high-fidelity HTML, CSS, and JQuery based prototypes for the applications home screen, event creation screens, detailed event view screen, volunteering screens, administrative controls, and user profile screens. The redesigned portions of the application reduced the new event creation time by over half, provided context and assistance during the event creation process, increased the visibility of upcoming events, and greatly improved the process of managing Googler's who had expressed interest in volunteer roles for specific events.<br><br>I worked closely with the lead engineer for the team to ensure that the prototypes I handed over were successfully translated into production ready Django templates.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Looking back, there are certainly some lingering issues I would loved to have tackled. The tooltip help-text I handed over in my final deliverable, while generally promoting increased clarity, could have been made clearer in certain instances. I regretted not having the copy cleaner and felt there was still a lot of room for improvement.<br><br>I also regret leaning too heavily on HTML5 placeholder help text throughout the redesign. The problem with placeholder text being that, when users start entering information into a form element the help text immediately disappears. In this instance I unfortunately prioritized aesthetics over usability. Going back I believe there would be room to augment placeholder help text with inline text not dissimilar from the excellent implementation that can be found in the Google Chrome Web Store developer dashboard editing screens.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>Event Connect was one of my favorite projects I worked on while at Google. I really enjoyed working with the project’s PM, <a class=""g-profile"" href=""http://plus.google.com/105367864363518973606"" target=""_blank"">+Melanie Saldana</a>, and lead engineer, <a class=""g-profile"" href=""http://plus.google.com/106139823293781683186"" target=""_blank"">+Eriel Thomas</a>. Both of these individual taught me a great deal and treated me with the utmost respect for the entirety of the time I worked with them. I miss them both a great deal and hope I might be fortunate enough to work with them again some day in the future.","","01,Create new event screen (01)-02,Create new event screen (02)-03,Detailed event view screen-04,Event discovery screen-05,New on campus event","&#xf0c1;,Balsamiq event form wireframes,http://goo.gl/7akB5o-&#xf0c1;,Administrative user interface sketches,http://goo.gl/Ns2yvM"
"lm-prototypes","LibertyMutual.com","2010 - 2011","Liberty Mutual Insurance","While working at Liberty Mutual I collaborated closely with several product teams in a prototyping and interaction design capacity. Specifically, I aided the iOS, Android, mobile/desktop consumer web, and eService account management teams with the creation of prototypes based on interactions I helped to design. <br><br>While working with these teams I helped design multiple iterations of Liberty’s <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/liberty-mutual-mobile"">native mobile applications</a>, <a href=""http://mobile.libertymutual.com/"">mobile</a> and <a href=""http://libertymutual.com/"">desktop</a> websites, <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office"">insurance office locator web-app</a>, and <a href=""https://eservice.libertymutual.com/PmEServiceDesktopClient/es/accmgt/login.html#login"">eService account management web-app</a>.<br><br>Because Liberty Mutual employed a single user-experience team which effectively loaned designers out to distinct product teams for short and long-term project work, I worked on a variety of consumer facing projects during my time with the company.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>From an organizational perspective, a problem with Liberty Mutual’s product teams was that they lacked dedicated designers. Instead of having embedded design and user-experience staff associated with each of Liberty’s product areas, instead a single design and user-experience team loaned its members to product teams on a temporary basis.<br><br>Because there was no unified method of design across teams, each project I contributed interaction design work toward required a very different set of deliverables to be handed off to their engineering teams. Due to this lack of unified structure, I was required to contribute very different types of interactions and artifacts on a project-to-project basis.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>I began each project at Liberty Mutual be meeting with PMs, developers, and business analysts separately to better understand the problem space I was entering and to also better understand the expectations each team held of my role as a designer. I found a lot of success at Liberty Mutual by very clearly articulating to a project’s stakeholders as early as possible the types of work I would be performing, the methodologies by which I would be performing that work, and the artifacts through which that work would manifest itself. For example, some product teams preferred actual frontend HTML and CSS while others preferred high-fidelity clickable prototypes with inline requirement annotations.<br><br>Setting expectations early and communicating those expectations in both written and visual forms saved me from doing a lot of unnecessary work that stakeholders either didn’t require or didn’t care for. It was a great lesson to learn early in my career as a designer.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>Having set expectations in terms of deliverables and a timeline for delivery, I also worked and interacted with project teams on a basis that suited their specific needs. Usually I began projects by better understanding the problems that a specific project was attempting to solve. Because I usually entered projects at a stage when their goals had already been defined, I typically didn’t have as much input into defining project constraints as I would have liked.<br><br>My typical design methods for a project started with more abstract methods like mind-mapping a problem space or conducting semi-structured user-interviews with Liberty’s current customers to better understand the shortcomings of our digital offerings. Having better understood the constraints around a project, I then moved into lower fidelity pen and paper prototypes which, after soliciting stakeholder feedback, would work their way through multiple iterations into wireframes.<br><br>Having created and received wireframe approval, I would then move into a stage of high-fidelity design. In this stage I created pixel-perfect static screens which could then be incorporated into both dynamic interactive prototypes and additionally into requirements documents with visible grids and measurements. These refined artifacts would then be used to inform and guide development teams in an iterative quality assurance process where I called out and corrected discrepancies between the productionised implementations and my original designs.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I was really happy with the finished results of the majority of the projects I did design and interactive prototyping work for while employed at Liberty Mutual. The screenshots I’ve included in this portfolio writeup include samples from prototypes I built for Liberty Mutual’s android claims application and desktop web mobile overview pages using Axure RP. There were times when I was frustrated by the way certain constraints impacted my design work. A good example of that frustration is visible in the finished design for Liberty’s <a href=”http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office”>insurance office locator</a> in that I was required to use Bing Maps even after advocating for a Google Maps API integration. <br><br>Working with constraints, for better or worse, is simply a part of any design process. It’s something that I’ve sought to improve working around on a personal and professional level.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Looking back on the design work I did at Liberty Mutual, there are a number of improvements I would have liked to have made across multiple projects. The original mobile page I designed suffered from overly small touch areas in its top-level menu structure which made navigation difficult depending on the size and resolution of the mobile phone being used to browse the site.<br><br>In another example of potential improvement, the office locator I designed didn’t default to an individuals current location automatically. Instead, the location tool always required some sort of manual input on the users behalf. I advocated for this feature heavily and incorporated different treatments of that functionality into my design proposals but it was ultimately trimmed from the projects production release due to limited engineering resources.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>Working at Liberty Mutual was my first professional exposure to user-experience. I gained a tremendous amount of experience working on some of Liberty’s consumer facing products and I learned a great deal from the talented designers and user-experience professionals I was fortunate enough to work alongside. Although I have no regrets about departing Liberty Mutual for a role with Google, I will always fondly remember my time at Liberty and I’m proud to see elements of my design work displayed across their products years later.","","01,Home screen prototype-02,Claim selection prototype-03,Auto details prototype-04,Auto images prototype-05,Desktop mobile web information prototype-06,Desktop iOS information prototype","&#xf0c1;,LM.com mobile optimized website,http://goo.gl/YDVi7d-&#xf0c1;,LM.com mobile application portfolio,http://goo.gl/7sJyLV"
"transparency-report","Google Transparency Report","Summer 2013","Google","In the summer of 2013 I designed the user interface and interaction flows as a part of a 20% project for an as yet unreleased section of the Google Transparency Report. The report I worked on focused on the display of distorted aerial and satellite imagery censorship in Google Maps.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>The biggest problem I faced on this project was the nature of the data my team and I were attempting to display. Historically, each section of the Google Transparency Report had featured dense amounts of data which were then augmented with interactive graphs. Because these reports were text and data heavy by design, it made user comprehension difficult.<br><br>While designing a report for distorted aerial imagery, I was faced with the problem of departing from the designs implemented in previous sections of the Transparency Report. I was tasked with creating a report that prioritized and prominently displayed imagery while also providing the rich data that users had come to expect from Google’s transparency reporting. These two objectives were oftentimes at odds with one another.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Before beginning substantial work on this project, I worked closely with the Transparency Report’s PM, a former designer who had worked with the team, a Google Map’s quality-lead, and a Google Earth imagery engineer to better understand the problem space and the larger obstacles our team faced.<br><br>Our team decided that in order for a new report to be considered successful it would need to prominently display imagery in a manner that allowed for dynamic filtering and categorization. We also agreed upon the need for users to have the ability to view and export additional data associated with censored images.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>I worked through this project in several stages of fidelity. I began first with pen and paper interface sketches before migrating some of my early work to low-fidelity Balsamiq renderings. Using those Balsamiq renderings through several iterations, I gained feedback from project stakeholders before moving to higher-fidelity Adobe Fireworks mockups.<br><br>After transitioning my early interface designs into a higher-fidelity, I then prototyped the interactions of a user through multiple scenarios within the distorted imagery report. I specifically focused on visually representing and understanding the interactions involved with multi-country distortion filtering.<br><br>Additionally, I created several visual treatments for grouping together related images in order to promote clarity and understanding for new and returning users.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>My final deliverables for this project were a set of high-fidelity mockups with well-defined and documented interactions for key user scenarios. This project was unfortunately placed on hold during implementation due to the changing priorities of the Transparency Reporting team and to date has not been released.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Looking back, there are areas of improvement I wish I’d had additional time to tackle. Specifically, I would have liked to have presented clearer indications to viewers of the report about the type of aerial distortions which were present. There are a number of different types of distortion censorship that can occur within Google Maps (camouflage, pixelation, masks, etc) and I did not incorporate methods into my design for users to gain additional understanding into each distortion type.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>I really enjoyed the time I spent working with the Google Transparency Report team and learned a great deal about Google’s larger transparency efforts in the process.","","01,Browse aerial imagery by country-02,United States aerial imagery overview-03,Aerial imagery distortion filters-04,Aerial imagery resorted by country-05,Aerial imagery current filter table view toggle","&#xf0c1;,Balsamiq layout & navigation wireframes,http://goo.gl/KiFBOU-&#xf0c1;,Early sketches & ideations,http://goo.gl/ZV7Ish"
"usmc-pro-fitness","USMC ProFitness","Spring 2012","United States Marine Corps","I set a new year’s resolution at the beginning of 2012 to design and build an end-to-end Android application. The result of that resolution was USMC ProFitness. The application I designed calculates a <a href=""http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/how-to-prepare/pft"">Physical Fitness Test (PFT)</a> score based on guidelines published by the United States Marine Corps.<br><br>Using the inputs of a user’s gender and age coupled with their 3-mile run time, 2 minute sit-up count, and maximum pull-up count, USMC ProFitness allows users to calculate and track their fitness scores over time and to share those scores with others.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>I chose to build USMC ProFitness primarily because the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrios.marinepft"">best-in-class Android PFT solution</a> circa early 2012 was difficult to use and rarely updated. Calculating a score, viewing archived scores, and sharing scores on existing solutions was tedious at best. I realized there was a lot of room to simplify the process.<br><br>Additionally since this was my first time building an Android application in its entirety, I appreciated the well structured logic that went into calculating a physical fitness score. From a programmatic standpoint I identified this as a great starter Android project.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Before beginning the design process, I decided that whatever solution I ended up implementing would need to reduce the time and overall number of steps required to calculate a PFT score on existing solutions. Additionally, I wanted to limit the number of ancillary features which had permeated the existing solution space. I also decided that my project would need calculate only a PFT score, and additionally create an easy mechanism for viewing and sharing previously recorded scores.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>Having taken numerous PFTs myself, I was already intimately familiar with the problem space. I did however conduct interviews with Marines who were both Android and iOS users so that I could better understand how they were using current solutions and what problems they felt needed to be addressed. Thinking back on the initial criteria I had defined for success, I began by sketching out different flows and interactions through which a user would create a profile, input score variables, and ultimately view their score reports. I then used those early sketches to create a low-fidelity clickable prototype that I demoed with the same group of Marines I had interviewed at the projects onset. <br><br>Having gained initial feedback on my early designs, I spent several weeks programming the the applications scoring logic and database structures. After some initial testing and bug fixes, I then implemented the high-fidelity designs I had originally created in a series of Android linear layouts.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I released USMC ProFitness into the Android marketplace in early 2012 and within six months it had garnered over 5,000 unique downloads. The app went on to generate close to 20,000 unique downloads before I eventually removed it from the Google Play Store due to my own lack of time to devote toward ongoing maintenance.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>I would love to revive this project at some point in the future and do a full material design implementation as the current implementation is certainly showing its age.<br><br>Additionally, I think there’s a lot that could be done with more extensible storage. The database I used in my first release of USMC ProFitness was a locally embedded SQLite relational database. Embedding the database locally meant that, if a user were to uninstall the application from their phone or tablet, they would lose their data. A great future project would be to sync that local database with an online storage solution like Google Cloud SQL.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>This project was a great learning experience on a personal level. Although I had contributed to Android projects prior to designing and building USMC ProFitness, completing an end-to-end solution myself has since helped to inform my design choices on future mobile projects now that I have a richer understanding of the Android development process.<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.patdugan.usmcprofitness""><img src=""https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png""/></a>","","01,Home screen-02,Profile creation-03,Test selection-04,Test score reporting-05,Previous test scores","&#xf016,Low fidelity application wireframes,http://goo.gl/KkCxkZ-&#xf0c1;,USMC ProFitness github page,http://goo.gl/x2A4Ca"
"google-glass","UW Husky Glass","2013 - 2014","University of Washington","While a graduate student at the University of Washington, I lead a project that attempted to use Google Glass to quantify improvements in the on-field performance of University of Washington NCAA football players by leveraging live and recorded video captured with Glass as a training mechanism. I worked on this project with Eve Riskin and Jessica Tran in UW's department of Electrical Engineering.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>The primary goal of this project was to provide the University of Washington football team with richer training and analysis materials in order to allow players to more effectively acclimate themselves with their playbook curriculum.<br><br>The Huskies current training methodology provides players with iPads which come installed with two separate applications. One application shows static drawings of football plays while the other shows a list of videos filmed from the sidelines of each play. Neither application communicates with the other. The problem therein lies that current football players have trouble:<ul><li>Understanding what a football play looks like in motion</li><li>Understanding what their individual role looks like in the context of a larger play</li><li>Understanding the perspectives of their teammates while a play is being executed</li></ul>Additionally, the football coaching staff also have trouble effectively understanding the actions or decision making process of their players due to their limited sideline perspective and viewing angles.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>At the onset of this project, our team decided that we needed to build a solution that meaningfully translated interactive learning materials into more effective on-field performance.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>After initially meeting with stakeholders from the Husky football team, my team and I quickly realized that a prime area for further enhancement was the development of interactive teaching aids using video and data captured from Google Glass.<br><br>We also agreed upon the fact that, while we believed Glass might provide useful in other ways, that at least initially we would focus on using Glass to capture video in soft-touch helmet-less practice sessions rather than in full-contact scenarios.<br><br>As a proof-of-concept, we built Glassware and a companion Android tablet application that allowed for players to view a football play’s wireframe schematic, put that schematic into motion, and then toggle the viewing perspective of the play between different offensive and defensive positions.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>My team and I were ultimately able to deliver a platform through which coaches and players could easily communicate during football practices. This platform consisted of Glassware the allowed players to view animated play schematics in real-time, an Android tablet application that allowed coaching staff to push plays onto specific players Google Glass units, and a web application that allowed for a summary review of individual practice sessions.<div class=""video-container""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mUBdi4ok7E"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><div class=""video-caption"">Husky Glass Demo Reel filmed at Husky Stadium.</div></div><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Since my team was largely focused on getting prototypes into the hands of players and coaches quickly, our application designs oftentimes prioritized functional aesthetics over highly polished visuals. Since I was also the lead developer on this project, I would have loved if I had been able to spend additional time improving the visuals of our Android and Web applications.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>While this project ultimately was wound down with the waning interest in Google Glass as a development platform, the experience as a whole taught my a lot about designing for and working with a very niche and interesting user group.","","01,Husky Glass Android app-02,Husky Glass web app","&#xf016,Husky Glass overview project poster,https://goo.gl/CDijS9-&#xf016,Husky Glass demo reel,https://goo.gl/kUjlPS-&#xf016,Project Github page,http://goo.gl/IQsDYb"

While my visual design skills weren't terrible, I knew there was room for them to improve.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>While enrolled at the Academy of Art, I specifically wanted to enhance my understanding of the Adobe Creative Suite in addition to my understanding of foundational visual design best practices.<br><br>Additionally, I wanted to expand my understanding of the design work that went into creating websites and applications. At the time of my initial enrollment, I had a great deal of web development experience but far less experience thinking and reflecting upon the user-centered design work that preceded actual development.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>I pursued coursework primarily in the department of Web Design & New Media with an additional elective in the school's Foundations program that focused on visual communication through sketching.

"mhiguera","Mhiguera.com","Fall 2011","Law Offices of Marie Higuera","In the Fall of 2011 I was contracted by Marie Higuera to create a  <a href=""http://mhiguera.com/"">website for her law office</a>. I worked closely with Marie on this project to better understand her desire for creating a website and to help her generate effective content and marketing materials for her law firm.<br><br>In addition to designing a web presence for Marie, I also helped her partner with the hosting service <a href=""http://www.hostgator.com/"">HostGator</a> and trained her administrative assistant in the use of high-level CSS and HTML so that he could maintain the site after its launch.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>The problem I was solving for on this project was that the law offices of Marie Higuera lacked any sort of meaningful online presence. This was especially problematic as many competing smaller law offices in Seattle has substantial online presence and were driving significant client acquisitions through their online reach.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>I met with Marie several times at the projects start to establish a set of criteria by which we would define the project’s success. Specifically we agreed that the final implementation would need to be able to:<ul><li>Provide Marie’s staff with metrics for tracking visitors</li><li>Provide meaningful calls-to-action that allowed visitors to directly contact Marie’s office by phone</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>While designing this site for Marie, I met with her on a recurring weekly basis to update her as to progress I was making and elicit her feedback throughout all stages of design. I used low-fidelity wireframes early in the project’s design stage and, having ensured that we were placing appropriate emphasis on her firm’s content, moved forward with the construction of higher-fidelity mocks.<br><br>Having received Marie’s final approval on my high-fidelity designs, I moved forward with development and the eventual implementation of her design. Post-launch, I worked closely with Marie’s administrative assistant and created a series of training documents that explained the methods by which he could update and add new site content.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I was happy with the way the website turned out. The project accomplished the initial success criteria that I had laid out with Marie and it began driving a non-trivial amount of traffic to her firm within two months of having been launched. Although I’ve seen the site slowly degrade in performance and the consistency of its design as updates have been made to it over the past two years, I still believe that it is accomplishing its purpose quite well despite now needing what probably amounts to a minor refresh.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Looking back, I can clearly identify changes I would have made to the final deliverable. Whereas Marie insisted that she needed a rotating slideshow of historic Seattle landmarks on the front-page, I should have pushed back and advocated for a cleaner less distracting site that prioritized her firm instead of the city of Seattle. I can also see she added transparent images to her site’s slideshow that overlap one another and which don’t speak to the professionalism of her firm’s work.<br><br>Additionally, although calls-to-action were incorporated throughout the site, the ability to place calls to her firm could have been prioritized higher in the hierarchy of certain pages.<br><br>Finally, due to the constraints of the original project, I implemented the site in a single language (English), when really I should have also incorporated a Spanish language version. Since so many of her clients were from Mexico and spoke English as a second-language, I should have incorporated dual language versions of the website into my initial success criteria.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>This project represented some of the first freelance work I did after departing from Liberty Mutual.

We used that prototype in a series of user research studies to better understand the expectations of our customers and to establish baseline functionality which we would target in the first release of our application.  <br><br>We were able to establish that a solution would need to offer users the ability to:<ul><li>Record rich data associated with automobile accidents</li><li>Easily talk to an insurance representative regardless of a user’s location within the application</li><li>View and update their current insurance information</li><li>View the status of an insurance claim after it had been filed</li></ul>We also deemed it was important to set into place tracking mechanisms so that we could establish an understanding of how many of our customers were using the application and for what purposes.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>Having established success criteria, I worked with an an information architect and a small team of mobile developers to begin significant construction of our application. Our team worked through several short iterative sprints developing core functionality that we then integrated together in a cohesive fashion.<br><br>During multiple stages of development, I contributed wireframes, requirements documents with inline annotations, and interactive clickable prototypes to our developer and business stakeholders. As developers implemented features, I also ran quality assurance tests looking for bugs and ensuring the our finished implementations aligned to my original design work.<br><br>Prior to publicly launching our application, I helped to plan and conduct an additional round of users studies. The feedback from those studies was ultimately incorporated in a final set of usability improvements.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>Our initial iOS application launch went extremely well considering it was our first in-house mobile development release. Members of the original iOS team and myself released the Android variant of our claims app several months later to similarly positive reviews.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Due to time constraints, the Android application our team released was in many ways a ported version of the application we released on iOS. Looking back, there was a substantial amount of android specific functionality our team neglected to implement.<br><br>Additionally, my team relied on webviews for specific account management functions rather than natively building features into our Android application. I would have loved to have taken additional time to build out a true native experience rather than use modified webviews as a developmental crutch.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>Looking at both applications today, I can still see evidence of my original design work. However, the applications themselves look and feel very different. Unfortunately, neither app today closely adheres to either iOS or Android design guidelines. <br><br>I was extremely proud to have positively impacted this project so heavily as a recent college graduate. Being as this was my first exposures to design in a professional setting, I gained a tremendous amount of experience in a very short time.<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lmig.pm.internet.mobile.android.libertymutual""><img alt=""Android app on Google Play"" src=""https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png"" /></a><br><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liberty-mutual-mobile/id397404511?mt=8""><img src=""http://public.libertymutual-cdn.com/MediaBin/PersonalMarket/SharedImages/app_store.gif?version=33122106156""/></a>","","01,Home screen-02,Auto claim (1)-03,Auto claim (2)-04,Filed claims-05,Add pictures","&#xf0c1;,Visio storyboards & wireframes,http://goo.gl/qBV9pv-&#xf0c1;,Forrester Research usability citation,http://goo.gl/yLySpU"
"smartcar","Smart Car User-Interface","Fall 2013","UW","While enrolled in an <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/design.html "">interaction design class (DESIGN 383)</a> at the University of Washington, I was part of a small team tasked with designing the user-interface of an embedded automotive system.<br><br>My team and I spent several weeks iterating through several forms of interaction between a car's occupants and its primary control mechanisms. <br><br>We eventually moved forward with a model of hybrid automation in which our car abstracted away control from the driver in situations where it could make a definitive decision regarding the manipulation of non mission-critical systems.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>The problem my team and I were solving for was the generally poor state of in-car information and entertainment interfaces. With several notable exceptions, one being Tesla, the vast majority of present-day vehicle user interfaces offer a poor user-experience.After performing a body of secondary competitive research, our team listed some of the primary issues with current in-car interfaces as being:<ul><li>Poor integration of a driver's smartphone with a car’s native computing systems</li><li>Overly complex nested menu structures for tasks like wayfinding</li><li>Inappropriately small touch-areas for primary interactions</li><li>Lack of supplementary analog controls to augment touch-screens</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>As my team and I moved forward with our project, we quickly realized that we needed to make the primary functionality of our car’s user interface extremely easy to use. We agreed that our final interface should be non-distracting to a driver, promote quick inputs and interactions, and be mapped in a way where a driver could perform functions without removing their eyes from the road. Additionally, we created a baseline metric that no primary interface interaction should require more than two seconds of a driver's attention from the time of intent to completion of action.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>In the context of my four person team, I worked as the primary interaction designer on this project. In that role, I contributed heavily to the early ideation process and <a href=""http://goo.gl/VPbC8o"">interface interaction sketches</a> our team used as a springboard into a higher-fidelity stage of interface design.<br><br>As part of my initial research into actions performed by drivers, I was able to establish four areas of specific focus for my team. Those areas of interaction included way-finding activities, climate control, entertainment, and communication. Using those four top-level hierarchies of control, I moved forward along the path of segmenting our car’s primary interface into four corresponding quadrants.<br><br>Moving past our period of initial pen and paper sketches, I was also primarily responsible for the initial body of line work and <a href=""http://goo.gl/qqMoLL"">interaction storyboards</a> our team used to inform our final deliverables. Some of the storyboards I completed mapped out the dynamics of the following user interactions with the center-console vehicle screen:<ul><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/XrxABU"">Receiving an incoming phone call</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/EUlHmT"">Placing an outgoing call</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/SNykti"">Viewing outside temperature and adjusting climate controls</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/SukebR"">Adjusting music playlists and control</a></li></ul>In addition to storyboarding different control interactions, I also designed some of our teams initial line work for a <a href=""http://goo.gl/45b0QQ"">behind-the-wheel dashboard console</a>. I additionally included design explorations that incorporated annotated text-messages in a behind-the-wheel digital dashboard even though I recognize this would be incredibly dangerous and inappropriate in situations where a vehicle was in motion.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>Since this project took place before any announcements were made regarding Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, I was happy with some of the design proposals my team and I were able to put forward given the limited information we had at the time. As in-car navigation and entertainment systems continue to improve in the coming years, I will be interested to see how far off our initial designs were from those systems that actually become publicly available.","","01,Home screen (music selection)-02,Top level music (touch)-03,Second level album selection-04,Second level album selection-05,Second level album selection (touch)-06,Album selection intent-07,Album selection intent-08,Album selection intent (touch)-09,New artist playing","&,Early stage interaction ideation sketches,http://goo.gl/VPbC8o-&#xf044;,User interaction storyboards,http://goo.gl/qqMoLL-&#xf16a;,Secondary console interface design,http://goo.gl/45b0QQ"
"reading","Reading Difficulty Eye Tracking Study","Fall 2013","University of Washington","In the Fall of 2013 while a student at the University of Washington, I worked as a research assistant to <a href=""http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/jmedero/"">Julie Medero</a> on her PhD thesis in the department of Electrical Engineering. While working for Julie I was responsible for recruiting and scheduling participants and for moderating guided eye-tracking studies, the aim of which was to generate data that would allow for the automatic characterization of text difficulty. I also assisted Julie with her analysis of the data generated from our individual user research sessions.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>Adults may struggle to read because they are not native speakers of English, because of learning disabilities, or simply because they did not receive sufficient reading instruction as children. In classroom settings, struggling readers can be given hand-crafted texts to read. The manual simplification of reading passages can be time-consuming and is not available for adults who are not in a classroom environment. The goal of this research was to provide a means of automatically identifying which portions of a reading passage might be difficult to understand for low literacy adults, and to furthermore suggest if a machine generated simplification is a good alternative.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>The results of this study can be found in Julie’s <a href=""http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~julie/publications/jmedero_thesis.pdf "">inclusive dissertation</a> which she <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerlMz3YaLw"">successfully defended</a> at the University of Washington in August of 2014.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>Prior to helping Julie with this project I hadn’t spent a great deal of time conducting strict academic research as most of the study’s I had planned and conducted were done in a professional environment. I was excited to help Julie on this project not only because I supported the goals of her research, but also because I was glad to have gained academic research exposure. Julie has since left UW and is now an <a href=""http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~julie/#Teaching "">Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College</a>. I wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors and am thankful for having had the opportunity to have worked alongside her.","","",""
"cloud-platform","Google Cloud Platform Usability Study","Winter 2014","Google","In the winter of 2014 I worked within a three person team to plan and execute a usability study focus on Google’s relational cloud storage offering, Google Cloud SQL. My team was comprised of Monica Caraway and Koen De Couck who are both graduate students in the HCDE program at the University of Washington. During the course of our study we worked closely with <a href=""http://www.joetullio.org/"">Joe Tullio</a>, a User Researcher based out of Google’s Fremont offices.<br><br>My team and I outlined three major goals for the study. First, we wanted to investigate the developer user experience associated with initializing and configuring a relational database on Google Cloud SQL. We additionally wanted to better understand and quantify obstacles that prevented or inhibited cloud developers from migrating data that exists on competing services. Finally, we aimed to provide our project sponsors at Google with actionable recommendations based on usability issues uncovered during our team’s study.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">Research questions</div>Our team also identified a series of research questions we hoped to answer with our study. A sampling of the questions we proposed are as follows:<ul><li>What features of Google Cloud SQL do developers prefer over competing cloud platforms?</li><li>What are the strengths of the current administrative and configuration tools offered by Cloud SQL? What are areas in which the current configuration tools for Cloud SQL can be improved?</li><li>What ease-of-use do developers associate with the database migration process from competing cloud platforms onto Cloud SQL? What are ways in which the migration process can be improved?</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">Running the study</div>In actually planning in executing the study, our team employed a task-based think-aloud protocol methodology. We also used several likert based questionnaires (including the System Usability Scale) which were administered to participants pre/post study and post-task.<br><br>Our team was able to recruit seven participants consisting of current masters students, developers, and data analysts working within technology centric fields. Four of the seven participants were located locally in Seattle and participated in our study in the <a href=""http://blogs.uw.edu/hcdelabs/labs/lute/"">UW LUTE lab</a>. The remaining 3 were participants located in Boston and the Bay Area who participated in the our study remotely.<br><br>While moderating individual sessions throughout our study, my team and I asked our participants to complete a series of nine task-based scenarios. The tasks we employed covered typical usage scenarios normally associated with developer use of a cloud based relational database. Examples of tasks included creating a new SQL instance, performance monitoring, data migration, and user permission modification.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">Findings</div>After aggregating the data we collected across our seven participants, we were able to call out elements of the current Cloud SQL implementation that were working well and that could benefit from improvement. As a part of that analysis, we also identified a number of both minor and major usability issues which we codified with the <a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/"">Nielsen Norman Group severity ranking scale</a> for usability problems. For every usability issue we identified, we also provided short and in some cases longer-term actionable recommendations by which those issues could be systematically addressed.<br><br>Our findings and recommendations can be explored in detail in the <a href=""http://goo.gl/Lxak4Y"">final presentation</a> we delivered in March of 2014.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>I really enjoyed both planning and conducting this study. Whereas I had previously conducted usability studies primarily focused on general audiences, this was the first time I had actually conducted a study that focused on a very niche user-group (in this case cloud developers). I also really enjoyed the opportunity to work with my team’s Google representative, Joe Tullio, and look forward to future opportunities to work with him again.","","","&#xf16a;,Preliminary Cloud Storage study proposal,http://goo.gl/D4DPoV-&#xf16a;,Cloud Storage Interaction Map,http://goo.gl/jHybLv-&#xf16a;,Cloud Storage Initial Study Plan,http://goo.gl/qgtw3k-&#xf16a;,Cloud Storage Study Testing Kit,http://goo.gl/7uCtcz-&#xf16a;,Findings Presentation,http://goo.gl/NXxm8m"

"nextdoor-events","Nextdoor Events","2014","Nextdoor","One of the first projects I worked on while employed at Nextdoor was a redesign of our company's local events calendar. I was solely responsible for the desktop + responsive web and Android designs of the feature (as well as a large portion of their front-end development). I additionally was responsible for designing and building every system email associated with the creation and sharing of events.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>Local events were originally launched on Nextdoor in 2013 for the web, Android, and iOS. Despite the feature having originally been launched almost two years before I joined Nextdoor, it remained largely untouched until a project team including myself was spun up in the fall of 2014. The original events features had been designed first on the web and then ported over to Nextdoor’s native mobile apps. This was reflected in missing mobile features, specifically the inability for Nextdoor members to create events from our mobile clients. Additionally, the majority of Nextdoor users polled about events either did not know events existed on Nextdoor, or had never actually used the feature to share an event. This indicated a serious discoverability problem.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Working with my project manager and design partner, we together agreed upon several key success metrics which we proposed to our executive board.  Specifically, we aimed to generate X% new members each month via an events funnel (where X is intentionally obscured). We also wanted to double the number of new events created and shared each month across all Nextdoor neighborhoods. Finally, we agreed that we would target a goal of having 70% of newly created events being marked publicly sharable by the event creator as a means of reinforcing our member growth metric.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>I worked on this project with a team that consisted of a project manager, four mobile engineers, two web and infrastructure engineers, and an additional designer. I was solely responsible for the desktop and mobile responsive web designs as well as the native android designs relating to this feature. I additionally was responsible for designing and building every system email associated with the creation and sharing of events.<br><br>Working with the other designer attached to this project, we identified several areas for improvement which included:<ul><li>Events were hard to discover and hard for users to create</li><li>Events were being used in ways the product wasn’t designed to handle</li><li>There was no way to share events with individuals outside a user’s neighborhood</li><li>Events could only be created on a desktop computer</li></ul>After conducting an initial series of interviews with current Nextdoor users in addition to polling active users of our current events platform, I converted a series of initial UI sketches into Balsamiq wireframes which I used as a basis for solidifying a feature set with my executive stakeholders. I then converted those lower fidelity renderings into high fidelity mock-ups in Sketch, and created a series of Invision prototypes which I used to communicate the features more nuanced interactions.<br><br>I worked closely with the projects mobile and web engineers to implement the designs I handed off. I additionally ended up committing into production a large portion of the the front-end for the project's web and android clients.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I was extremely happy with the final product our team shipped. From a metrics standpoint, 83% of new events created were shared publicly far exceeding our original goals. Additionally, our team increased the number of visible events on the average Nextdoor user’s calendar by 400%. Using this project as a basis for experimentation, our team was also able to introduce a series of new UI components on Nextdoor's web and mobile platforms that we were then able to roll-out to other portions of our site and mobile clients following the conclusion of this project.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>There were several features left off our original release that I felt would have improved the events experience a great deal. Specifically, our team failed to ship an in-event discussion system due to the complexity of the cross-neighborhood sharing model we implemented. We also were unable to ship an event categorization system which would have greatly improved the ability of users to filter and search for specific types of events.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>I was really happy with the way this project turned out. This was also one of the larger projects I worked on at Nextdoor. It was a great experience to work cross-functionally and to design and develop for both Nextdoor’s web and android clients. I ultimately helped shipped a product that dramatically improved the ability of our members to create and share events with one another and the feature is still being widely used today.","","01,New event creation (Android)-02,Event Calendar (Android)-03,Detailed event view (Android)-04,New event creation (Web)-05,Event Calendar (Web)-06,Detailed event view (Web)","&#xf0c1;,Balsamiq events detailed view wireframes,https://goo.gl/5SfSzW-&#xf0c1;,Balsamiq postbox explorations,https://goo.gl/cy5p7R"
"altschool","AltSchool Teacher Console","2014","AltSchool","In the Winter of 2014 I worked with another Designer Fund Bridge partner company, AltSchool, to draft a design proposal for a new version of their teacher administrative console. Specifically, AltSchool wanted to find ways to improve an existing component of their teaching administrative console called a Playlist Activity Editor. The Playlist Editor is a tool that teachers use to build and plan classroom exercises for their students.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>The original Playlist Editor had been built rapidly and without the support of a full-time designer. AltSchool recognized that as their company grew to employ additional teachers that they would need to fundamentally rethink the way this critical piece of software and initially been designed. The Playlist Editor itself had a minimum feature set that included:<ul><li>The ability to create an activity with a title, image, and description</li><li>The ability to allow for the addition of separate steps for students to complete</li><li>Incorporating the means of assigning activities to a student or class</li><li>Allowing for optional multi-media student input for each step in an activity</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Working with the AltSchool design team, I decided on a set of design criteria for a Playlist Editor redesign that included:<ul><li>An emphasis on flexibility during the activity creation process</li><li>The treatment of activities as top level entities distinct from students</li><li>The minimization of the time required to create an a new activity</li><li>A means of ensuring activities could accommodate multiple media and input types</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>Before beginning any major design work on this project, I did a series of initial interviews with several grade school teachers to better understand how they ran their classrooms and the type of technology they utilized to plan their lessons. Having gained an initial understanding of how these teachers worked and the types of problems they faced, I began design work with a series of initial <a href=""https://goo.gl/B8kyg7"">UI sketches and a relational data map</a> using sample lessons provided to me by AltSchool.<br><br>Having explored several design directions in sketches, I began converting my initial designs into digital <a href=""https://goo.gl/NCzXgx"">lower fidelity mocks</a> using Balsamiq. After gaining additional feedback on my Balsamiq designs from the teachers I had earlier interviewed, I moved my designs into a higher fidelity using Sketch. I ultimately created a click-through <a href=""https://invis.io/QD28LLMNS"">Invision prototype</a> which I used to do further usability testing and to validate my design decisions.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I ultimately handed over my designs, prototypes, and user research to the AltSchool design team as artifacts to use toward their redesign effort. My role in this project was limited to exploratory design work and the user research I conducted. I was not involved in the implementation of the recommendations or proposals I put forward.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Given my limited involvement in this project, there were several areas of improvement that I was unable to design for given time constraints. Specifically, I believed the designs I put forward could be improved by:<ul><li>Adding visual confirmations after a teacher selected or uploaded a photo</li><li>Allowing for the assigning of an activity to multiple students</li><li>Add one-time dismissible cues to explain more confusing parts of UI</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>I love AltSchool’s mission and I think the design team there is doing a great job given their small size. I enjoyed being able to contribute to the redesign of their Playlist Editor and wouldn’t hesitate to work with them again in the future.","","01,Teacher Playlist overview-02,New lesson plan creation modal-03,Lesson plan photo selection modal-04,Lesson plan detail editing (1)-05,Lesson plan detail editing (2)","&#xf0c1;,Early UI and data relation sketches,https://goo.gl/B8kyg7-&#xf0c1;,Balsamiq editor UI explorations,https://goo.gl/NCzXgx-&#xf0c1;,Usability study script and outcomes,https://goo.gl/NxJ9Br-&#xf0c1;,Invision prototype,https://invis.io/QD28LLMNS"
"tweak-the-tweet","Twitter Crisis Response App","Winter 2013","University of Washington","While a student at the University of Washington, I worked with <a href=""http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/"">Professor Kate Starbird</a> to design and build an android client for her <a href=""http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/tweak-the-tweet.html"">Tweak the Tweet</a> project. Tweak the Tweet is an idea for utilizing Twitter as a two-way communication channel for information during emergencies, crises, and disasters. This project aimed to formalize these communications to make the information shared easier to process and redistribute back to the public.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>While the initial phase of the project had been focused on building a web client, when I joined the project in 2013 no significant work had begun on building a companion mobile client. There did however exist an <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17697907/hcid/hcid521/Materials/TtT%20Design%20Spec.pdf"">android design specification document</a> created by a previous graduate student. Looking at the design specification, I observed several issues existed with the proposed direction of the companion android app. Specifically:<ul><li>The application adhered to virtually none of the android design principles and lacked a visual hierarchy</li><li>The information architecture of the app was generally confusing</li><li>Attaching a physical location to a tweet was extremely cumbersome</li><li>Entering any tweet was more difficult than it needed to be</li></ul>In general, the proposed application was over-designed, confusing to navigate, and actually discouraged tweeting due to the tedious a text-entry process.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>As the purpose of this application was supposed to facilitate a more efficient flow of important information during a crisis, the difficult to navigate and confusing to use design specification seemed to stand in direct opposition to the project's goals. I decided that the focus of my prototype would be ease of use. Individuals in a crisis already have enough to deal with without worrying about the additional cognitive load a confusing application might be placing upon them.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>I spent a weekend building a proof of concept prototype with the goal of simplifying the proposed mobile experience. I started by sketching a rough user-flow through the application, used the understanding I gained from that exercise to build a functional working prototype, and concluded by cleaning up the user interface as best I could given the time constraints I was working under.<br><br>My application consisted of the following screens:<ul><li>Login: Individuals can login to the application using their existing Twitter account</li><li>Nearby events: Rather than display all crises happening, I limited the application to search for crises occurring within a 100 mile radius</li><li>Send tweet: I consolidated and automated functionality that spanned multiple screens in the design spec into a single screen</li></ul>A user's flow through my application consisted of signing-in, selecting a nearby crises, and ultimately tweeting out information about that crises. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2v9xpLKoxQ"">As can be seen in this video demonstration I created</a>, in 60 seconds (in most cases far less) a user can sign into the application for the first time and tweet out important information attached to their current location.<br><br>While building this prototype I used the <a href=""http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html"">Twitter4j library</a> to authorize a user's twitter account and send out tweets directly from within the app. I also used the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/"">Google Map android API</a> to spatially represent the radius of a crisis area and to automatically determine a user's location in order to embed that information automatically in their tweet.<br><br>The code for my prototype is available on my <a href=""https://github.com/pdugan20/tweak-the-tweet"">Github page</a> and the working APK can be <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfUmZrak1ZNXdCSms/edit?usp=sharing"">downloaded here</a>.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>The end result of my work was a functional prototype that allowed users to gain an quick understanding of a crisis situation and effectively communicate with emergency responders. The app that I designed and built was easier to use and far more simplified than the one proposed in the initial design spec I started working with. I ended up handing off my work to Professor Kate Starbird for additional feature development and closer integration with her existing crisis response infrastructure.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>Given that I built this prototype over a weekend, there were some features I didn't get the chance to implement. If I did have additional time to build this project out further, I would work on improving the following features:<ul><li>Implement ability to attach pictures to tweets</li><li>Implement a location toggle (on/off) instead of automatically including a user's current address</li><li>Allow user to see a list-view of their previously sent crisis-related tweets</li><li>View a live-stream of tweets with a specific crisis hashtag</li><li>Improve discoverability and usefulness of label identifiers</li></ul><div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>Overall, I was really happy with the quality of this prototype considering I only had a few hours to design, build and debug it. Projects like these are a great chance to roll up your sleeves and really crank on solving a complex problem in a short period of time.","","01,Login screen-02,Crisis identification screen-03,Structured tweet screen","&#xf0c1;,Project Github repo,https://goo.gl/0Ym1z6-&#xf0c1;,Prototype video walkthrough,http://goo.gl/qE1ggT-&#xf0c1;,Android prototype download link,https://goo.gl/PlQVkY"
