I worked for several months in the summer of 2013 to design the user interface and interactions for an as yet unreleased section of the Google Transparency Report. The report I worked on focused specifically on the display of blurred and distorted aerial imagery in Google Maps. I worked directly with the Transparency Report’s PM and stakeholders from the Google Maps team to create an interface that allowed individuals to categorize and filter distorted aerial imagery by both distortion type and geographic location.

<div class="project-sub-head">The problem</div>
The single biggest problem I faced on this project was the nature of the data I was attempting to display. Existing sections of the Transparency Report historically featured dense amounts of data which were then augmented with interactive graphs using the Google Visualization API. Each report was text-heavy by design.

<br><br>When designing a report for distorted aerial imagery, I was faced with the problem of departing from the Transparency Reports historical conventions. I was tasked with creating a report that prioritized and prominently displayed images while also providing the rich data and context that users had come to expect from Google’s transparency reporting. As these two objectives could at times be at odds with one another, the problems I faced as a designer were somewhat substantial.

<div class="project-sub-head">Defining criteria for success</div>
Before beginning substantial work on this project, I met with the Transparency Report’s PM, a previous designer who had worked with the team, a Google Map’s quality-lead, and a Google Earth imagery engineer to better understand the problem space and some of the larger obstacles standing in the way of a successful implementation.

<br><br>Having met with these individuals and gained their input, our team decided that in order for a new report to be considered successful it would need to prominently display imagery in a manner that allowed for dynamic filtering and categorization. We also agreed upon the need for users to have the ability to view and export additional data associated with the images that fell within their filtering preferences.

<br><br>The final deliverables for the project were designated as a set of high-fidelity static mockups that we could present to an engineering team. That engineering team, pending their approval, would then allocate the appropriate resources to begin working on an productionised implementation.

<div class="project-sub-head">Moving forward</div>
I worked through the project in several stages of fidelity. I began first with pen and paper interface sketches before migrating some of my early work to low-fidelity Balsamiq screens. Using those Balsamiq screens through several iterations, I gained feedback from project stakeholders before moving to higher-fidelity Fireworks screens.

<br><br>After migrating my early interface designs to higher-fidelity mockups, I then prototyped the interactions of a user through multiple scenarios within the distorted imagery report. I specifically focused on visually representing and understanding the interactions involved with multi-country distortion filtering.

<br><br>Additionally, I worked closely with the project team to ensure that user’s viewing the report for the first time weren’t immediately overwhelmed with imagery out of context. I created several visual treatments for grouping together related images in order to promote clarity and understanding for new and returning users.

<div class="project-sub-head">How it all turned out</div>
I was really happy with the way my contributions on the project turned out. My final deliverables for this project were a set of high-fidelity mockups with well-defined interactions for key user scenarios. I unfortunately returned to graduate school before seeing the project get the chance to move further along past the initial design work I contributed.

<div class="project-sub-head">Room for future improvement</div>
Looking back, there are certainly some areas of improvement I wish I’d had additional time to tackle. Specifically, I would have liked to have presented clearer indications to viewers of the report about the type of aerial distortions which were present. There are a number of different distortions within Google Maps (camouflage, pixelation, masks, etc) and I unfortunately didn’t incorporate a method for users to gain additional understanding into the elements that made up each distortion type.

<div class="project-sub-head">Final thoughts</div>
I had an awesome time working with the Transparency Report team and learned a great deal about Google’s transparency efforts in the process. Since this was one of the last major projects I worked on before departing Google for graduate school, it is a little bittersweet thinking back on this project in particular. Overall though, I’m glad I was able to assist the transparency team and consider myself fortunate they were able to bring me on in a design capacity.
