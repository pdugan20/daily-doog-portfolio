I am currently enrolled in an interactive prototyping studio <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/hcid.html"">HCID 521</a> at the University of Washington. As a part of the studios curriculum, I am required to <a href=""http://blogs.uw.edu/hcid521/assignments"">construct a variety of prototypes in various mediums</a> in both a group setting and on an individual basis. Additionally, I will be making <a href=""http://blog.dailydoog.com/"">bi-weekly updates to my blog</a> documenting my design process on these assignments. As time allows, I will compile an annotated list of my work within this portfolio entry.
