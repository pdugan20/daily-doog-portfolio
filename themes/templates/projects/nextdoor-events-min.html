One of the largest projects I worked on while employed at Nextdoor was a redesign of our company's local events calendar feature. Local events were originally launched on Nextdoor in 2013 for the web, Android, and iOS. The feature allowed Nextdoor members to share and plan nearby events with their neighbors.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>Although the original events feature had been launched in 2013, it largely remained untouched until a project team including myself was spun up in the fall of 2014. The original events features had been designed first on the web and then ported over to Nextdoor’s native mobile apps. This was reflected in missing mobile features, specifically the inability for Nextdoor members to create events from our mobile clients. Additionally, the majority of polled users either did not know events existed on Nextdoor, or had never actually used the feature to share an event which indicated a serious discoverability problem.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>Working with my project manager and design partner, we together agreed upon several key success metrics which we proposed to our executive board.  Specifically, we aimed to generate X% new members a month via an events funnel (where X is intentionally obscured). We also wanted to double the number of new events created and shared each month across all Nextdoor neighborhoods. Finally, we agreed that we would target a goal of having 70% of newly created events being marked publicly sharable by the event creator as a means of reinforcing our member growth metric.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">MOVING FORWARD</div>I worked on this project with a team that consisted of a project manager, four mobile engineers, two web and infrastructure engineers, and an additional designer. I was solely responsible for the desktop and mobile responsive web designs as well as the native android designs relating to this feature.<br><br>Working with the other designer attached to this project, we identified several areas for improvement which included:<ul><li>Events were hard to discover and hard for users to create</li><li>Events were being used in ways the product wasn’t designed to handle</li><li>There was no way to share events with individuals outside a user’s neighborhood</li><li>Events could only be created on a desktop computer</li></ul>After conducting an initial series of interviews with current Nextdoor users in addition to polling active users of our current events platform, I converted a series of initial UI sketches into Balsamiq wireframes which I used as a basis for solidifying a feature set with my executive stakeholders. I then converted those lower fidelity renderings into high fidelity mock-ups in Sketch, and created a series of Invision prototypes which I used to communicate the features more nuanced interactions.<br><br>I worked closely with the projects mobile and web engineers to implement the designs I handed off. I additionally ended up committing into production a large portion of the the front-end for the project's web and android clients.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">RESULTS</div>I was extremely happy with the final products our team shipped. From a metrics standpoint, 83% of new events created were shared publicly far exceeding our original goals. Additionally, our team increased the number of visible events on the average Nextdoor user’s calendar by 400%. Using this project as a basis for experimentation, our team was also able to introduce a series of new UI components on web and mobile that we were then able to roll-out to other portions of of site and mobile clients following the conclusion of our project.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</div>There were several features left off our original release that I felt would have improved the events experience a great deal. Specifically, our team failed to ship an in-event discussion system due to the complexity of the cross-neighborhood sharing model and engineering complexity. We also were unable to ship an event categorization system which would have greatly improved the ability of users to filter and search for specific types of events.<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">FINAL THOUGHTS</div>I was really happy with the way this project turned out. This was also one of the larger projects I worked on at Nextdoor. It was a great experience to work cross-functionally and to design and develop for both Nextdoor’s web and android clients. I ultimately helped shipped a product that dramatically improved the ability of our members to create and share events with one another and the feature is still being widely used today.
