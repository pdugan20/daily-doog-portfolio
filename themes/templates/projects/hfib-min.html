Health Food in a Box (HFIB) was a four week project I completed while enrolled in an <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/hcid.html"">analytical design studio (HCID 511)</a> at the University of Washington. The project consisted of selecting a problem space and iterating through potential solutions that advocated for technology influenced behavioral change. Over the course of the project I helped lead a small group through ideation, storyboarding, and cognitive mapping exercises. The final deliverable for this project was a pitch presentation my team delivered to the executive committee of the University of Washington HCI program.<br><br>A key tenant of this project aimed to build regional communities around preparing and eating healthy meals in the home. The mobile application we proposed designing acted as a portal into a personalized produce delivery platform.<br><br>My team’s final proposal was a variation on traditional CSA produce boxes in that instead of allowing individuals to order boxes full of generic produce, they could instead order and have shipped to their home a complete set of ingredients in the right proportion and cultural preference for their family.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem space my group and I identified centered around healthy eating in a family setting. Specifically, we identified the need for working parents to more effectively be able to plan, shop for, and prepare healthy, minimally-processed meals for their families.<br><br>Our final solution proposal proposed a cross-platform mobile app that paired with an on-demand regional food delivery service. We envisioned parents creating a family profile which specified the number of individuals in their household and their specific diet preferences. Users of the app would then be able to shop for recipes and would be able to have the all the ingredients used in preparing those recipes shipped to their home within a timeframe of their own choosing. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>While we initially sought to target families across all income ranges and geographic areas within the United States, we quickly narrowed our focus and instead designed a solution we believed worked well for medium and upper-income families with one or two working parents. <br><br>In order for our project to be successful, we agreed that our solution would need to:<ul><li>Significantly differentiate itself from traditional CSA boxes</li><li>Advocate for ordering meals in as few steps as possible similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468482"">Amazon 1-click ordering</a></li><li>Be tested in urban areas where economies of scales could be leveraged to reduce delivery costs</li><li>Quickly build algorithms that could reliably forecast future produce purchases to increase ingredient freshness while also reducing warehousing costs</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having laid out an initial body of work and success metrics upon which we could benchmark our potential solutions, my team and I moved forward by conducting extensive market research into academic studies concerned with healthful eating. We also examined current best practices and the associated research involved with designing for behavioral change. We quickly identified and moved forward with BJ Fogg’s <a href=""http://www.behaviormodel.org/"">behavioral change model</a> and used it to inform our early designs.<br><br>Having gained a better understanding our our problem space, we drafted a series of personas and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfTUpHQjBNNnRhT2M/edit?usp=sharing"">user storyboards</a> that laid out in detail our produce delivery process. Using those storyboards, we were able to develop a refined understanding of what features were the most important to leverage in our proposed solution.<br><br>Using the understanding we gained through our storyboarding exercises, my team and I drafted an initial set of wireframes and used them as a basis for creating a refined <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOn70drOiMfenJENG81VkNGXzA/edit?usp=sharing"">pitch</a> that we ultimately presented to a faculty review board. <div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>My team’s final presentation was well received by our audience. Additionally, the knowledge I gained on this project proved invaluable. I improved my ability to identify a problem space, narrow the focus of my work, understand of constraints within that space, and to design a solution that at its core influenced the behavior of users in the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices.<br><br>The goal of this project was not to deliver a finished product, but rather, to deliver a pitch which convincingly advocated for pursuing a problem and proposed solution further. To that end, I believe my team and I did an excellent job framing and articulating our arguments.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on this project our team stumbled at certain points. Specifically, we failed to clearly articulate and gain consensus on our criteria for success early in the project. This lack of early consensus resulted in individuals pursuing very different paths of research and ideation we led to an ineffective use of our already constrained resources.<br><br>Additionally, our team black-boxed the more complicated portions of our proposal that involved the regional on-demand logistics of produce delivery. I believe that if we had conducted additional research into potential delivery partnerships, that we could have presented a more convincing argument to our faculty audience.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Healthy Food in a Box was the first longer-term project I worked on in my HCI masters program. The experience of getting to know my peers was invaluable, and I learned a tremendous amount about designing for behavioral change. I was pleased with the final solutions my team and I proposed and would love to at some future date build out some of our application wireframes into a higher fidelity.
