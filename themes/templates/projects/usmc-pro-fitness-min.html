I set a new year’s resolution at the beginning of 2012 to design and build an end-to-end Android application. The result of that resolution was USMC ProFitness. The application I designed calculates a <a href=""http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/how-to-prepare/pft"">Physical Fitness Test (PFT)</a> score based on guidelines published by the United States Marine Corps.<br><br>Using the inputs of a user’s gender and age coupled with their 3-mile run time, 2 minute sit-up count, and maximum pull-up count, USMC ProFitness allows users to calculate and track their fitness scores over time and to share those scores with others.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>I chose to build USMC ProFitness primarily because the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrios.marinepft"">best-in-class Android PFT solution</a> circa early 2012 was quite over designed. Calculating a score, viewing archived scores, and sharing scores on existing solutions was extremely difficult. I realized there was a lot of room to simplify the process.<br><br>Additionally since this was my first time building an Android application in its entirety, I appreciated the well structured the logic that went into calculating a physical fitness score. From a programmatic standpoint I identified this as a great starter Android project.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before beginning the design process, I decided that whatever solution I ended up implementing would need to reduce the time and overall number of steps required to calculate a PFT score on existing solutions. Additionally, I wanted to limit the number of ancillary features which had permeated the existing solution space. Therefor, I also decided that my project would need calculate only a PFT score, and additionally create an easy mechanism for viewing and sharing previously recorded scores.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having taken numerous PFTs myself, I was already intimately familiar with the problem space. I did however conduct interviews with Marines who were both Android and iOS users so that I could better understand how they were using current solutions and what problems they felt needed to be addressed.Thinking back on the initial criteria I had defined for success, I began by sketching out different flows and interactions through which a user would create a profile, input score variables, and ultimately view their score reports. I then used those early sketches to create a low-fidelity clickable prototype that I demoed with the same group of Marines I had interviewed at the projects onset. <br><br>Having gained initial feedback on my early designs, I spent several weeks programming the the applications scoring logic and database structures. After some initial testing and bug fixes, I then implemented the high-fidelity designs I had originally created in a series of Android linear layouts.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I released USMC ProFitness into the Android marketplace in early 2012 and within six months it had garnered over 5,000 unique downloads. Feedback was initially positive until a bug introduced in newer versions of Android caused users to receive inaccurate score reports. Overall I was happy that I had created a simplified score calculation solution and additionally pleased that I had gained a more holistic understanding of the Android application development process.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>I would love to at some future date to address several bugs that have cropped up in USMC ProFitness. A well designed solution doesn’t amount to much if the programmatic logic behind that solution is flawed.<br><br>I would also love to refresh the application to more closely adhere to Android’s design principles and patterns. Looking at the application today, its glaringly obvious that I could get rid of chrome in a lot of places,<a href=""http://developer.Android.com/design/building-blocks/buttons.html"">like the buttons</a>, and would make the app more pleasing to use as a result.<br><br>Additionally, I think there’s a lot that could be done with more extensible storage. The database I used in my first release of USMC ProFitness was a locally embedded SQLite relational database. Embedding the database locally meant that, if a user were to uninstall the application from their phone or tablet, they would lose their data. A great future project would be to sync that local database with an online storage solution like Google Cloud SQL.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>This project was a great learning experience on a personal level. Although I had contributed to Android projects prior to designing and building USMC ProFitness, completing an end-to-end solution myself has since helped to inform my design choices on future mobile projects now that I have a richer understanding of the Android development process. I hope to one day soon find time to refresh the design and to squash some of those scoring bugs!<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.patdugan.usmcprofitness""><img src=""https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png""/></a>
