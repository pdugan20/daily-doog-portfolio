While working at Liberty Mutual I collaborated closely with several product teams in a prototyping and interaction design capacity. Specifically, I aided the iOS, Android, mobile/desktop consumer web, and eService account management teams with the creation of prototypes based on interactions I helped to design. While working with these teams I helped design multiple iterations of Liberty’s <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/liberty-mutual-mobile"">native mobile applications</a>, <a href=""http://mobile.libertymutual.com/"">mobile</a> and <a href=""http://libertymutual.com/"">desktop</a> websites, <a href=""http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office"">insurance office locator web-app</a>, and <a href=""https://eservice.libertymutual.com/PmEServiceDesktopClient/es/accmgt/login.html#login"">eService account management web-app</a>.<br><br>Because Liberty Mutual employed a single user-experience team which effectively loaned designers out to distinct product teams for short and long-term project work, I worked on a variety of consumer facing projects during my time with the company.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>From an organizational perspective, a problem with Liberty Mutual’s product teams was that they lacked dedicated designers. Instead of having embedded design and user-experience staff associated with each of Liberty’s product areas, instead a single design and user-experience team loaned its members to product teams on a temporary basis.<br><br>Because there was no unified method of design across teams, each project I contributed interaction design work toward required a very different set of deliverables to be handed off to their engineering teams. Due to this lack of unified structure, I was required to contribute very different types of interactions and artifacts on a project-to-project basis.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>I began each project at Liberty Mutual be meeting with PMs, developers, and business analysts separately to better understand the problem space I was entering and to also better understand the expectations each team held of my role as a designer. I found a lot of success at Liberty Mutual by very clearly articulating to a project’s stakeholders as early as possible the types of work I would be performing, the methodologies by which I would be performing that work, and the artifacts through which that work would manifest itself. For example, some product teams preferred actual frontend HTML and CSS while others preferred high-fidelity clickable prototypes with inline requirement annotations.<br><br>Setting expectations early and communicating those expectations in both written and visual forms saved me from doing a lot of unnecessary work that stakeholders either didn’t require or didn’t care for. It was a great lesson to learn early in my career as a designer.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Having set expectations in terms of deliverables and a timeline for delivery, I also worked and interacted with project teams on a basis that suited their specific needs. Usually I began projects by better understanding the problems that a specific project was attempting to solve. Because I usually entered projects at a stage when their goals had already been defined, I typically didn’t have as much input into defining project constraints as I would have liked.<br><br>My typical design methods for a project started with more abstract methods like mind-mapping a problem space or conducting semi-structured user-interviews with Liberty’s current customers to better understand the shortcomings of our digital offerings. Having better understood the constraints around a project, I then moved into lower fidelity pen and paper prototypes which, after soliciting stakeholder feedback, would work their way through multiple iterations into wireframes.<br><br>Having created and received wireframe approval, I would then move into a stage of high-fidelity design. In this stage I created pixel-perfect static screens which could then be incorporated into both dynamic interactive prototypes and additionally into requirements documents with visible grids and measurements. These refined artifacts would then be used to inform and guide development teams in an iterative quality assurance process where I called out and corrected discrepancies between the productionised implementations and my original designs.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really happy with the finished results of the majority of the projects I did design and interactive prototyping work for while employed at Liberty Mutual. The screenshots I’ve included in this portfolio writeup include samples from prototypes I built for Liberty Mutual’s android claims application and desktop web mobile overview pages using Axure RP. There were times when I was frustrated by the way certain constraints impacted my design work. A good example of that frustration is visible in the finished design for Liberty’s <a href=”http://www.libertymutual.com/find-sales-office”>insurance office locator</a> in that I was required to use Bing Maps even after advocating for a Google Maps API integration. <br><br>Working with constraints, for better or worse, is simply a part of any design process. It’s something that I’ve sought to improve working around on a personal and professional level.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on the design work I did at Liberty Mutual, there are a number of improvements I would have liked to have made across multiple projects. The original mobile page I designed suffered from overly small touch areas in its top-level menu structure which made navigation difficult depending on the size and resolution of the mobile phone being used to browse the site.<br><br>In another example of potential improvement, the office locator I designed didn’t default to an individuals current location automatically. Instead, the location tool always required some sort of manual input on the users behalf. I advocated for this feature heavily and incorporated different treatments of that functionality into my design proposals but it was ultimately trimmed from the projects production release due to limited engineering resources.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Working at Liberty Mutual was my first professional exposure to user-experience. I gained a tremendous amount of experience working on some of Liberty’s consumer facing products and I learned a great deal from the talented designers and user-experience professionals I was fortunate enough to work alongside. Although I have no regrets about departing Liberty Mutual for a role with Google, I will always fondly remember my time at Liberty and I’m proud to see elements of my design work displayed across their products years later.
