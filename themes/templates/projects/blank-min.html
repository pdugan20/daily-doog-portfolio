One of the largest projects I worked on while employed at Nextdoor was a redesign of our company's local events calendar feature. Local events were originally launched on Nextdoor in 2013 for the web, Android, and iOS. The feature allowed Nextdoor members to share and plan nearby events with their neighbors.<br><br>
<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>
Although the original events feature had been launched in 2013, it largely remained untouched until a project team including myself was spun up in the fall of 2014. The original events features had been designed first on the web and then ported over to Nextdoorâ€™s native mobile apps. This was reflected in missing mobile features, specifically the inability for Nextdoor members to create events from our mobile clients. Additionally, the majority of polled users either did not know events existed on Nextdoor, or had never actually used the feature to share an event which indicated a serious discoverability problem.<br><br>
<div class=""project-meta-heading p-summary header-clear"">SUCCESS CRITERIA</div>
Working with my project manager and design partner, we together agreed upon several key success metrics which we proposed to our executive board.  Specifically, we aimed to generate X% new members a month via an events funnel (where X is intentionally obscured). We also wanted to double the number of new events created and shared each month across all Nextdoor neighborhoods. Finally, we agreed that we would target a goal of having 70% of newly created events being marked publicly sharable by the event creator as a means of reinforcing our member growth metric.<br><br>

I worked on this project with a team that consisted of a project manager, four mobile engineers, two web and infrastructure engineers, and an additional designer. I was solely responsible for the desktop and mobile responsive web designs as well as the native android designs relating to this feature.<br><br>
