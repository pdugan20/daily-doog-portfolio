While enrolled in an <a href=""http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/design.html "">interaction design class (DESIGN 383)</a> at the University of Washington, I was part of a small team tasked with designing the user-interface of an embedded automotive system.<br><br>My team and I spent several weeks iterating through several forms of interaction between a car's occupants and its primary control mechanisms. We eventually moved forward with a model of hybrid automation in which our car abstracted away control from the driver in situations where it could make a definitive decision regarding the manipulation of non mission-critical systems.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem my team and I were solving for was the generally poor state of in-car information and entertainment interfaces. With several notable exceptions, one being Tesla, the vast majority of present-day vehicle user interfaces offer a poor user-experience.After performing a body of secondary competitive research, our team listed some of the primary issues with current in-car interfaces as being:<ul><li>Poor integration of a driver's smartphone with a car’s native computing systems</li><li>Overly complex nested menu structures for tasks like wayfinding</li><li>Inappropriately small touch-areas for primary interactions</li><li>Lack of supplementary analog controls to augment touch-screens</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>As my team and I moved forward with our project, we quickly realized that we needed to make the primary functionality of our car’s user interface extremely easy to use. We agreed that our final interface should be non-distracting to a driver, promote quick inputs and interactions, and be mapped in a way where a driver could perform functions without removing their eyes from the road. Additionally, we created a baseline metric that no primary interface interaction should require more than two seconds of a driver's attention from the time of intent to completion of action.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>In the context of my four person team, I worked as the primary interaction designer on this project. In that role, I contributed heavily to the early ideation process and <a href=""http://goo.gl/VPbC8o"">interface interaction sketches</a> our team used as a springboard into a higher-fidelity stage of interface design.<br><br>As part of my initial research into actions performed by drivers, I was able to establish four areas of specific focus for my team. Those areas of interaction included wayfinding activities, climate control, entertainment, and communication. Using those four top-level hierarchies of control, I moved forward along the path of segmenting our car’s primary interface into four corresponding quadrants.<br><br>Moving past our period of initial pen and paper sketches, I was also primarily responsible for the initial body of line work and <a href=""http://goo.gl/qqMoLL"">interaction storyboards</a> our team used to inform our final deliverables. Some of the storyboards I completed mapped out the dynamics of the following user interactions with the center-console vehicle screen:<ul><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/XrxABU"">Receiving an incoming phone call</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/EUlHmT"">Placing an outgoing call</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/SNykti"">Viewing outside temperature and adjusting climate controls</a></li><li><a href=""http://goo.gl/SukebR"">Adjusting music playlists and control</a></li></ul>In addition to storyboarding different control interactions, I also designed some of our teams initial line work for a <a href=""http://goo.gl/45b0QQ"">behind-the-wheel dashboard console</a>. At my team’s insistence, I included annotated text-messages in a version of that dashboard screen even though I recognize this would be incredibly dangerous and inappropriate in situations where a vehicle was in motion.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>This project is still a work in progress! I will make amendments to this portfolio entry as soon as my team and I have completed our final set of deliverables.
