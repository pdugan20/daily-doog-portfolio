While working as a member of Liberty Mutual’s user experience team I proposed and led a project that examined the current state of the various RSS feeds across Liberty’s consumer facing web properties. Then, having conducted a competitive analysis of the methods by which RSS was incorporated into competing insurance websites, I created a set of proposals for a series of small RSS-centric projects. <br><br>The aim of these projects was to present a more unified RSS experience across Liberty’s websites while also consolidating similar feeds, eliminating duplicated feeds, and focusing content within feeds to be be more narrowly focused on our company’s target demographic. <div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The reason I proposed and began the initial work on this project was due to the state of Liberty Mutual’s various RSS feeds being quite disparate in early 2011. RSS feeds were incorporated on six of Liberty’s web properties. In each case, the methods by which the RSS feed was represented was different. <br><br>Similarly, different explanations were provided within each site of what an RSS feed was and how an individual might use that feed. Finally, the content within Liberty’s many feeds was in most cases not specific to the insurance industry and consisted of a variety of miscellaneous and sometimes irrelevant articles. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Before moving forward with the project, I worked with my user-experience peers and managers to identify criteria for success. Specifically, we decided that any RSS project should at a minimum:<ul><li>Put into place mechanisms to measure subscribers to RSS feeds</li><li>Consolidate sitewide definitions of RSS</li><li>Create a singular page from which users could subscribe to multiple RSS feeds in a consistent fashion</li><li>Eliminate ancillary RSS feeds while also ensuring the content within feeds was specific to the insurance industry</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>Before moving too far into my own consolidation project, I extensively researched RSS best practices incorporated by Liberty Mutual’s insurance competitors. I additionally researched consumer usage of RSS feeds and the methods by which individuals interacted with various RSS services in existence at the time.<br><br>In an informal feedback poll I sent out to current Liberty Mutual subscribers, I was able to ascertain that a small subset of our users did in fact use RSS readers on a regular basis. Of that subset, a surprising majority expected companies like Liberty Mutual to produce insurance themed RSS feeds. That minority also expressed interest in subscribing to insurance feeds they found relevant to their own lives.<br><br>Having conducted broader RSS market research and also having completed an extensive in-house analysis of Liberty’s own RSS treatments, I created a set of proposals that I presented to an engineering managerial audience. The goal of my presentations was to advocate for engineering resources to implement my proposed RSS unification and consolidation projects.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really pleased with the findings of the research I conducted and with the proposals I put forward for future project work. Unfortunately, although I received positive feedback and support following my presentation, due to limited engineering constraints my proposals were approved for future work but weren’t actually allocated engineering resources. This effectively placed them in a state of limbo where the remained until I departed Liberty Mutual for Google.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back on this project, I spent a lot of time focusing my research on the RSS solutions that had been implemented by insurance companies. I would have done well to have broadened my research earlier in the project to the implementation of RSS feeds regardless of site content.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>Although I was disappointed that I was unable carry any of my proposals through to fruition, I was happy that I was able to interface with a variety of different stakeholders. I was similarly pleased that rather than having a well defined problem handed to me, I instead identified and presented concise solutions for a problem space that others had failed to recognize as being important. I learned quite a bit from this project.
