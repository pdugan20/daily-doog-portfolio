In the Fall of 2011 I was contracted by Marie Higuera to create a  <a href=""http://mhiguera.com/"">website for her law office</a>. I worked closely with Marie on this project to better understand her desire for creating a website and to help her generate effective content and marketing materials for her law firm.<br><br>In addition to designing a web presence for Marie, I also helped her partner with the hosting service <a href=""http://www.hostgator.com/"">HostGator</a> and trained her administrative assistant in the use of high-level CSS and HTML so that he could maintain the site after its launch.<div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>The problem I was solving for on this project was that the law offices of Marie Higuera lacked any sort of meaningful online presence. This was especially problematic as many competing smaller law offices in Seattle has substantial online presence and were driving significant client acquisitions through their online reach.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>I met with Marie several times at the projects start to establish a set of criteria by which we would define the project’s success. Specifically we agreed that the final implementation would need to be able to:<ul><li>Provide Marie’s staff with metrics for tracking visitors</li><li>Provide meaningful calls-to-action that allowed visitors to directly contact Marie’s office by phone</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>While designing this site for Marie, I met with her on a recurring weekly basis to update her as to progress I was making and elicit her feedback throughout all stages of design. I used low-fidelity wireframes early in the project’s design stage and, having ensured that we were placing appropriate emphasis on her firm’s content, moved forward with the construction of higher-fidelity mocks.<br><br>Having received Marie’s final approval on my high-fidelity designs, I moved forward with development and the eventual implementation of her design. Post-launch, I worked closely with Marie’s administrative assistant and created a series of training documents that explained the methods by which he could update and add new site content.<div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was happy with the way the website turned out. The project accomplished the initial success criteria that I had laid out with Marie and it began driving a non-trivial amount of traffic to her firm within two months of having been launched. Although I’ve seen the site slowly degrade in performance and the consistency of its design as updates have been made to it over the past two years, I still believe that it is accomplishing its purpose quite well despite now needing what probably amounts to a minor refresh.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Looking back, I can clearly identify changes I would have made to the final deliverable. Whereas Marie insisted that she needed a rotating slideshow of historic Seattle landmarks on the front-page, I should have pushed back and advocated for a cleaner less distracting site that prioritized her firm instead of the city of Seattle. I can also see she added transparent images to her site’s slideshow that overlap one another and which don’t speak to the professionalism of her firm’s work.<br><br>Additionally, although calls-to-action were incorporated throughout the site, the ability to place calls to her firm could have been prioritized higher in the hierarchy of certain pages.<br><br>Finally, due to the constraints of the original project, I implemented the site in a single language (English), when really I should have also incorporated a Spanish language version. Since so many of her clients were from Mexico and spoke English as a second-language, I should have incorporated dual language versions of the website into my initial success criteria.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>This project represented some of the first freelance work I did after departing from Liberty Mutual. While I was certainly constrained in the amount of time I had available to spend on the project, I was ultimately happy with the finish result.
