I am currently working in a three-person team that includes myself, Monica Caraway, and <a href=""http://koendecouck.be/"">Koen De Couck</a> to conduct a usbility study focused on the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/"">Google Cloud Platform</a>. Specifically, my team and I will be investigating usability issues associated with the operation and maintenance of Google's relational storage offering, <a href=""https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/"">Google Cloud SQL</a>. Our advisor on this project is <a href=""http://www.joetullio.org/about/bio.html"">Joe Tullio</a> who currently works as a User Research on Google's cloud platform. I will update this portfolio entry as time allows.
