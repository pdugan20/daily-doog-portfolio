In the winter of 2014 I worked within a three person team to plan and execute a usability study focus on Google’s relational cloud storage offering, Google Cloud SQL. My team was comprised of Monica Caraway and Koen De Couck, both of which were Master’s students in the HCDE program at the University of Washington. During the course of our study, we worked closely with <a href=""http://www.joetullio.org/"">Joe Tullio</a>, a User Researcher based out of Google’s Fremont offices.<br><br>My team and I outlined three major goals for the study. First, we wanted to investigate the developer user experience associated with initializing and configuring a relational database on Google Cloud SQL. We additionally wanted to better understand and quantify obstacles that prevented or inhibited cloud developers from migrating data that exists on competing services. Finally, we aimed to provide our project sponsors at Google with actionable recommendations based on usability issues uncovered during our team’s study.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Research questions</div>Our team also identified a series of research questions we hoped to answer with our study. Our questions includes:<ul><li>What features of Google Cloud SQL do developers prefer over competing cloud platforms?</li><li>What are the strengths of the current administrative and configuration tools offered by Cloud SQL? What are areas in which the current configuration tools for Cloud SQL can be improved?</li><li>What ease-of-use do developers associate with the database migration process from competing cloud platforms onto Cloud SQL? What are ways in which the migration process can be improved?</li></ul><div class=""project-sub-head"">Running the study</div>In actually planning in executing the study, our team employed a task-based think-aloud protocol methodology. We also used several likert-based questionnaires (including the System Usability Scale) which were administered to participants pre/post study and post-task.<br><br>Our team was able to recruit seven participants consisting of current masters students, developers, and data analysts working within technology centric fields. Four of the seven participants were located locally in Seattle and participated in our study in the UW LUTE lab. The remaining 3 were participants were located in Boston and the Bay Area and conducted the test remotely.<br><br>While moderating individual sessions without our study, my team and I asked our participants to complete a series of nine task-based scenarios. The tasks we employed covered typical usage scenarios that would normally be associated the use of a cloud based relational database. Examples of tasks included creating a new SQL instance, performance monitoring, data migration, and user permission modification.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Findings</div>After aggregating the data we collected across our seven participants, we were able to call out elements of the current Cloud SQL implementation that were working well and that could benefit from improvement. As a part of that analysis, we also identified a number of both minor and major usability issues which we codified with the <a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/"">Nielsen Norman Group severity ranking scale</a> for usability problems. For every usability issue we identified, we also provided short and in some cases longer-term actionable recommendations by which those issues could be systematically addressed.<br><br>Our findings and recommendations can be explored in detail in the <a href=""http://goo.gl/Lxak4Y"">final presentation</a> we delivered in March of 2014.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>I really enjoyed both planning and conducting this study. Whereas I had previously conducted usability studies primarily focused on general audiences, this was the first time I had actually conducted a study that focused on a very niche user-group (in this case cloud developers). I really enjoyed working in conjunction with my team’s Google representative, Joe Tullio, and look forward to future opportunities to work with him again.
