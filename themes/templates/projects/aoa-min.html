While working full-time at Google, I pursued a part-time study in the school of Web Design & New Media at the San Francisco Academy of Art University. As a part-time student and taking night-classes, I completed the following four courses:<ul><li>Design Technology (WNM105)</li><li>Visual Design Principles (WNM110)</li><li>User Experience I (WNM120)</li><li>Sketching for Communication (FND113)</li></ul>The courses in which I was enrolled were designed to build a student’s competency with the Adobe Creative suite while also reinforcing the foundations of visual design and user experience.  <div class=""project-sub-head"">The problem</div>Although I had gained a significant amount of professional user experience exposure at the time of my enrollment in the Academy of Art University, I realized that in order to become a better Interaction Designer I needed to build upon my visual design competency. I would call my design work up until this point adequate, but I knew that exposure to individuals with deep artistic backgrounds would benefit my own skill-set tremendously. <div class=""project-sub-head"">Defining criteria for success</div>Upon enrolling at the Academy of Art, I defined criteria by which I would define the success of my coursework. Specifically, I wanted to enhance my understanding of the Adobe Creative Suite in so far that it would aid and enhance my ability to design interactions. <br><br>I don’t think of myself as a visual designer. I believe I am most effective when working as an interaction and experience designer that uses visual design as a supplement to convey and inform others of the interactions I create.<br><br>Additionally, I wanted to expand my understanding of the design work that went into creating websites and applications. At the time of my initial enrollment, I had a great deal of web development experience but far less experience thinking and reflecting upon the user-centered design work that preceded actual development.<br><br>Furthermore, I also decided that I would not accept on a personal level any final grade below an A-.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Moving forward</div>I pursued coursework primarily in the department of Web Design & New Media with an additional elective in the Foundations program that focused on visual communication through sketching. I began classes in the summer of 2012 and concluded my time at the academy in the spring of 2013 shortly before I departed the bay area for Seattle. <div class=""project-sub-head"">How it all turned out</div>I was really happy that I had the chance to build out my understanding and competency in the area of visual design. Regardless of a designer’s field or area of expertise, having a diverse and complementary background across multiple design disciplines helps inform ones work by providing a richer background of experiences from which they can draw.<br><br>I was able to meet some really talented instructors and students while enrolled at the school. Although I don’t believe any one project warrants its own portfolio entry due to their limited scope and short durations, I have collected some samples of my work in this portfolio entry to act as a collection of subset of my student deliverables.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Room for future improvement</div>Since I was a Googler first and student second while taking classes at the Academy of Art, I oftentimes wasn’t able to devote the appropriate amount of time I would have liked to for specific projects. Reflecting back on some of my work, I turned in several assignment in semi-complete states primarily because I lacked the time resources to fully realize my ideas.<div class=""project-sub-head"">Final thoughts</div>I was ultimately pleased with the final quality of my assignments and was equally thrilled to have been provided the chance to develop my sketching and ideation skill-set.
